1,1,1-Nov-19,"This is an exciting new innovative product in the emerging category of Sleep Health. Study after study confirm a definite linkage between sleep habits on psychological mood, physical health and longevity. This product works by monitoring your sleep habits, measuring key metrics that go beyond the Apple Watch sleep trackers I use measuring heart rate and body movement. PROS ——— + Sleep Heath benefits are far-reaching + Comfort, like wearing a ball cap to bed + innovative technology with reliable design + SleepMapper app integration into Apple Health app + incredibly promising product with huge potential benefits CONS ——— - Lost sensor data is frustrating, it’s all or nothing, no partial sessions - Sticky sensor attaches only behind the right ear (cable length) - Cost prohibitive for some - Sensor pads 30-pack for $30 unless you carefully re-use - Requires patience and dedication for full benefits Narrow user restrictions - 18 years - 50 years of age - sleep 5 - 7 hours per night - No sleep disorders (insomnia, apnea, etc) - Fall asleep within 30 minutes with few wake-ups - No medication or alcohol dependency to fall asleep Philips advised it might take the full 2-week evaluation period before benefits become obvious, but I can tell you this product did help me my first night using it I actually got less sleep, but of higher-quality, and awoke fresh and energized. Possible placebo effect, perhaps. Subsequent usage provided slightly more sleep than previously, with fluctuating sleep scores in the SleepMapper app. It achieves this by sensing how deeply you are sleeping. When it determines you begin to drift awake before completing a full “sleep cycle”, it pulses subsonic tones through the headband, keeping you under longer. All is not perfect though, I had two disconnects during the trial period where I awoke feeling great, hoping to see a high sleep score, but after plugging the headband into the micro-USB charger (which “ends” the sleep session), and syncing the data, I was sadly informed that the unit lost connection to the sensor data overnight. No sleep score for you. Bummer. Philips manual says to use a drop of water on your forehead under the front sensor, which I did, but believe the problem is bc I typically sleep on my right side, the same side the sensor “ear bone” connector attaches to, and noticed it had slid lower than usual, disrupting contact. This product shows tremendous potential, but I’m having difficulties giving it a whole-hearted recommendation. If sleep is important to you, this product is likely to help, but it’s a little finicky, and slightly uncomfortable at first (though initial discomfort subsided and I continue to use it nightly beyond the review period). All in all I believe this product will continue to get better via Firmware and Software updates.",25
1,2,1-Nov-19,"My fiancé doesn’t get enough sleep. She works long hours and then spends her evenings taking care of our family. She’s the first one up in the morning and the last one to bed at night. So, there is a lot that rests on her shoulders. As a result, she doesn’t get the most amount or the best quality of sleep. When I heard about this device, I thought it might be able to help her with sleeping deeper, longer so that she was more rested throughout the day. There were several observations I made about the headband as we tested it. First of all, it requires that the user wear it overnight. Therefore, you have to be comfortable with having something on your head while you sleep. My fiancé was a bit worried about this requirement at first, but when she tried on the headband she said it was actually quite comfortable. The fabric that is used is really soft and it ended up being a really nice fit for her head. It has some cushioning in a few places which make it feel like an extension of your pillow. The next observation we made was that the headband charges using Micro USB. Even though this option provides a less expensive connection, I sort of feel that it’s an older technology and I would much rather see USB-C used on newer devices. That said, Philips does include a Micro USB to USB-A cable and a power adapter that plugs into a standard outlet along with the headband. The cable is woven and flat to help prevent tangling. The instructions note that even though the headband has some charge out of the box that the user will need to charge it for a few hours in order for it to have enough battery life to make it through the night. This made for a small speed bump in our user experience. At it turns out the headband has just enough battery life for one night’s use. Therefore, you have to charge it every single day in order to use it at night. It would be nice if this device had at least two nights worth of charge available in my opinion. The next thing we noticed was that you have to manually sync the data from the headband to the app on the phone. It’s a quick and easy process, but it’s something you have to remember to do every day in order to get the greatest benefit from the device. When we synced the data from the headband and found that my fiancé had earned a high sleep score of 95 out of 100. This was calculated by the time asleep, any deductions for sleep stages, and any sleep boost she might have received from the headband. We happen to have a smart bed that also helps to track sleep data so we compared her score from the night she used the headband to the night directly following and found that her score was only a couple of points different. She actually experienced more restless sleep on the night she used the headband than the night she didn’t. On a few additional occasions, she reported that a reading wasn’t recorded or the headband slipped off of her head. One unfortunate side effect of using the headband for deeper sleep was oversleeping the next morning. My fiancé ended up sleeping right through her alarm. She did wake up just in time to get ready for work and get my daughter to school on time, but it was a rushed morning. As a result, she has been nervous about using the headband on nights when she has work the next morning. She said she felt a little better rested than normal, but it wasn’t a huge difference. We’ve only had the headband for a couple of weeks so it’s hard for my fiancé to make a full determination of how it’s helping (or not helping) her throughout the day yet. While I like the concept of this device, and so does my fiancé, but the expense is quite high and since some of the steps are ones you have to complete manually, so it’s a little bit of an inconvenient device to work with.",8
1,3,1-Nov-19,"I’d like to start off by saying that I feel the Philips SmartSleep Deep Sleep headband actually did make a difference in my alertness and ability to function normally on days following nights where I slept less than 7 hours. The product is specifically for people who usually get less than 6 hours of sleep or regularly sleep only 5 to 7 hours due to choice or lifestyle. That’s a really important point because if you have a sleep disorder or condition like insomnia or sleep apnea this product isn’t designed to help you. There are a lot of conditions you have to meet in order to use the device as well, for example: be under the age of 50, be able to hear 80 dB, and be able to fall asleep quickly without any aid. Since I met all of the requirements I thought that product might be a good fit for me. As a reference point, I normally need between 8 and 9 hours of sleep to function optimally the next day and feel refreshed. I know from experience that when I sleep less than that, I wake up feeling tired, am exhausted throughout the day, and sometimes get headaches or even migraines when I’m sleep deprived over consecutive days. So in order to faithfully test out this product, I restricted my sleep to 5 to 7 hours per night for two weeks straight to align my habits with the target consumers and determine if the product could actually help me sleep less and feel optimal, or at least normal, the following day. What I found was that, yes, on nights where I slept fewer than 7 or even 6 hours, even though I felt terrible shortly after wakening, that feeling did not persist throughout the day, and after about an hour I actually felt alert enough to get through work, concentrate on tasks, and power through pretty late into the night without needing to take a nap or generally feel too exhausted. Even while following this routine for multiple days back-to-back I never got to the point where I had bad migraines or decided I couldn’t handle the restricted amount of sleep. From a functionality standpoint, the sensors on the headband always picked up their signals immediately, after placing a drop of water on my forehead under the contact point. Syncing the data with the app the next day was simple too. The app logged the data that the headband tracked during the night and gave me an insightful breakdown of my sleep pattern and progress over time. My first night with the device I slept 5 hrs and had a sleep score of 51 with a Sleep Boost measurement of 14. After several more nights, some where I got 6 hours of sleep or more, I regularly received Sleep Boost scores in the mid to high 20s; as a result my total sleep scores were in the 90s, and sometimes hit 100. That said, if you get more than 7 hours of sleep the app will always give you high sleep scores, so it’s unclear how much the device is helping you, if you get adequate sleep. In general, the higher the sleep score form the night before, the better I felt and functioned the next day. Only once during the two-weeks did the headband shift and disconnect in the middle of the night, because I rolled over and the headband slipped off my forehead, resulting in only a partial data set for that night. I generally do not move a lot in my sleep. The headband itself has a pretty nice construction. It’s made from a soft, stretchy, slippery fabric like performance athletic clothing and is lightweight overall. The headband’s design is not unlike a regular sports sweatband but with some electronics embedded inside: earpieces on each side for delivering sound into your ear and a secondary forehead band for one of the sensors. The forehead sensor strip is removable for cleaning, though none of the rest of the headband has removable parts. Since you can’t submerge the headband in water due to the electronics inside, washing it in the washing machine is out of the question and you’re limited to wiping it down with a damp cloth. I would have preferred the parts of it that come in direct contact with your skin and hair to be removable for washing. The second sensor consists of a disposable gel pad that you stick behind your right ear and snap onto a wire just under the right earpiece. I did find that upon removal, this sticky sensor left a tacky residue behind my ear that was difficult to clean off, even with soap, warm water, and scrubbing with a terry cloth. The headband comes in two sizes: medium and large; I got the medium size as this supposedly fits most users. However, for me, it was not a comfortable product to wear nightly. I thought perhaps it was due to the size because I had the band expanded to the max and it was snug, though according to the manual this is appropriate as long as it is not overly tight, which I didn’t think it was. The headband also loosened up over time and by the end of the first week didn’t feel as tight, and I even needed to use the adjusters to make it smaller. Since the headband goes over your ears, your ears are pressed flat against your head for the duration of the night. This actually bothered me a lot because I would wake up with pain and soreness at the back of my ears, akin to the feeling of wearing on-ear headphones or earmuffs for too long. The earpieces also prevented me from side-sleeping because the components inside the earflaps are somewhat hard, and I could feel them quite clearly when I slept against them. However, my discomfort was mainly due to the fact that the headband adjusts via two flat metal brackets (not removable) at the back of the headband. I had the headband at the max circumference and the brackets sat right in the center at the back of my head. I get that they’re thin and lightweight and very durable, but so is Velcro, or silicone, or a whole host of other materials other than solid metal. Since I’m a back sleeper, this resulted in the brackets digging into the back of my head as soon as I put my head down. This was somewhat mitigated by changing from a feather pillow to a memory foam one, though it was still very palpable. I’m not normally aware of waking up at all during the night, and if I do I usually fall back asleep pretty quickly, but I noticed (and the sensors noticed) that I was waking up during the night more often when wearing the headband. This was particularly annoying because when I would wake, I was aware of how uncomfortable the headband felt and this kept me up, making it difficult for me to fall asleep again. In the mornings I would wake up with a sore spot at the back of my head just under the where the brackets sat, due to the friction, pressure and abrasion they applied to my skin. That, coupled with the ear pain made this, albeit effective sleep booster, a poor user experience as a whole. I just didn’t want to use the product despite what it could do for me. I wore the headband nightly over the course of 14 days to see whether or not my opinion on this point would evolve over time, but it did not. I really wanted to like this smart sleep headband, and I felt like it really did improve the quality of sleep I got, when it was limited. But the experience of using it was, on a whole, not pleasant. I think the technology is great, and a few design changes could make this an amazing product as it would potentially put a few hours back into my day when I could really use it.",12
1,4,1-Nov-19,"I have irregular sleep patterns: sometimes, I get a lot of sleep, but most of the time, I get very little. My daily activities and my health are affected when I don’t get good sleep. After two weeks of using the Philips Smart Sleep Deep Sleep Headband, I am impressed by how it has helped me improve my daily sleep. Before the headband, I was getting on average, seven hours of sleep, going to bed around nine pm, and waking up at four am. After using the headband, I now wake up at five, six, and even seven am, getting a daily average of 9 hrs of sleep. The headband has also boosted the quality of sleep. It is simple to use, but before using it, it must charge for about 2 hours. Download the SleepMapper app and follow the instructions. Attach a new sensor behind the right ear, place the headband on the head, and snap the connector to the sensor. Adjust headband if necessary and then turn it on. Once the app establishes a reading, you can go to sleep. I got the Medium size for my head size, and it fits okay, and the sensor was comfortable. It is adjustable but for up to head size of 23.5inch (ca. 60 centimeters) circumference. The large is for people with a head size of 23.5 inches (ca. 60 centimeters) to 26inch (ca. 66 centimeters) in circumference. It is very lightweight and easy to put on. The kit includes plenty of sensors and may be used again (only if the gel is present and it is still sticking well). On the app, you can view and compare how deep your sleep is. It also gives each sleep a Score, which helps you analyze if your sleep quality is getting better or falling off. Overall, I love this product and would highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their sleep.",3
1,5,1-Nov-19,"Summary: The Philips SmartSleep headband is a great tool to help you improve your sleep but will not make you sleep better. It's a great concept but needs some fixes some bugs. I had the chance to try out the Philips SmartSleep Deep Sleep Headband, I had been having issues with sleep and thought this was a good chance for me to improve my sleep. I work in a demanding job that require me to work long hours and then after it's more work at with my personal side business so sleep can be a luxury at times. Out of the box, you're going to get a the headband itself, 3 packets of SmartSleep sensors for behind your ear and the charger with cable.The SmartSleep sensor must be kept dry so make sure you always reseal the provided ziplock bags. I was a bit confused at how or orientate which way the head band going but the quick starter guide was really helpful in explaining everything, so make sure to read the quick starter guide. At first use, the app is really easy to set up and pair with the headband but that's where things end. When you first use the app for the first time, it's somewhat confusing on what you're supposed to do and if you need to push a button for it to start recording but through the couple of weeks that I've had the SmartSleep headband I've encountered some issues as well as some fixes I found on my own. One of the main things is, when the app updates it tends to not be able to connect the headband. There were a few frustrating nights that I couldn't connect but I had to fully exit the program, once I did that the app and head band connected, no further issues. One additional issue I found, was the headband missed a few recording. A couple of day I expected the head band to record the data but failed to. One last thing I found was that if you occasionally sleep for 3 hours wake and do not reconnect to the app it does not record the data. I few times I woke up to use the restroom, the next day I tried to sync the data but did not have data to record. In conclusion this is a great tool to help understand your sleeping habits and help you improve upon them. This system won't improve your sleep if you're not willing to improve on the results. This also need some work to fix the bugs I've experienced.",3
1,6,1-Nov-19,"Let's jump right into this as this is one of the more perplexing items/reviews I've done; pros - quality -- the fit and finish (well, not the *actual* fit, but more on that later), materials, and overall feel of everything is top notch. It's Philips; in my experience with their products (headphones, earbuds, lights, shavers, etc etc) this is something they've long-since excelled at - ingenuity -- Philips always seems to be pushing the envelope in any number of categories. While others are putting out gimmick after gimmick, these folks seem to actually attempt to delve into areas that can help and improve people's day-to-day lives; not just sell them another paperweight. - information -- on the nights where the headband works (again, more on this in a bit) it appears to provide a great bit of information and insight into your sleep patterns and the quality of that sleep cons - comfort -- this thing simply isn't all that comfortable. I looked up the measurements and bumped that against every single fitted hat I have purchased in the last ~25 years. This measure put me a good 3/4"" off from the max setting on the MEDIUM size. I have the strap all the way to it's largest possible setting and it is extremely snug. I have short hair (shaved down to 0 on the sides, 1/2"" up top) so that has very little to do with this. The measurements are simply off and it makes wearing it for an entire evening a chore if you don't get it absolutely spot on position-wise on your head. - consistency -- there are nights where you will get a ""good beep"" meaning that you're connected and good to go, only to wake up and see that ""no data was collected due to a faulty connection"". This happened on ~25% of the nights I wore it over the course of 14 days. - behind the ear disposable sensor -- This gets it's own category even though it sort of ties into the previous. con. The manual recommends that you change the sensor you stick behind your ear (more on *that* in a second, as well) at least every 3 days and that if any debris, hair, oil, etc etc gets on it that you are to dispose of it and use a new one immediately as it can cause the faulty connection to take place. This means if you open one from the packaging and it gets a hair on it before you can apply it, or you bump it against anything oily, etc etc etc you run the risk of collecting zero data that evening even if you get a ""you're good to go"" confirmation via the audible tone and/or app on your phone. Sorry, but that just isn't going to fly. There is so much potential for this thing, but these disposable sensors are laughable. Talk about a waste...there *has* to be a permanent solution to this thing, because my laymen's view of it is that it's nothing more than, ""we *could* provide that, but we aren't because now we get to sell you these disposable do-dads and keep your money coming to us for years to come if you want your device to work in any way, shape, or form."" This con is also in direct odds with my ""ingenuity"" pro up above, but this is the ONE area from a tech stand-point that is bothersome. It just happens to be HUGELY bothersome. By the way; these are $30 for a 30-pack... And while my pros appear to be strongly outweighed by my cons I still think this device has massive potential. If I were able to get the LARGE that would have removed one of the cons for comfort. And if the sensor behind your ear wasn't so finicky and/or not of the disposable variety there would be little if anything to nitpick about other than it maybe occasionally messing up every 4-5 days on my data. I could live with that. But, that isn't the case...so it gets 3 stars out of 5 along with a recommendation so long as you can live with all of the aforementioned annoyances.",6
1,7,1-Nov-19,"I've delayed writing this review because I wanted to give it every possible chance. It does most of what it claims to do; monitors brainwave activity, produces white noise to prevent you from waking up from deep sleep, and provides extensive feedback on how you sleep. But, it didn't actually help me sleep better. The first problem for me was the headband itself. It always felt as though I'd forgotten to take off my toque (a type of hat, for you non-Canadians). It was difficult for me to get comfortable with this on my head. Once asleep, it apparently did produce the white noise. I live in a very quiet area, though,and my S.O. does not snore, so noise really isn't my issue.The sleep reports are detailed and extremely interesting - if you're running a sleep study. If you're just looking for a good night's sleep, I don't understand the point. With all of this said, I can't help but feel that it would be right for some folks who don't get enough deep sleep. It's just that that person, apparently, is not me. I do wish Best Buy had a third option on ""Would you recommend this to a friend?"" It seems this is a case that ""maybe"" would be the right answer.",4
1,8,1-Nov-19,"As most 40 somethings in America I get tired and drowsy during the day while I am at work. I was looking for something to help me increase my quality of sleep at night. I can get to sleep easy enough but wasn't getting that deep sleep I use to have when I was younger. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this smart sleep headband, but after using it for a month I am convinced that it has helped me get better sleep. I wasn't sure what size to get, but going with the large was a good call for me instead of the medium. I think the medium would be good for a woman. The headband is easily adjustable. You will definitely need to download the SleepMapper app to get all of the information on your sleep patterns. It feels very comfortable on your head but there is a slight nuisance putting on the sensors behind your ears every night. Within 3 to 4 days I felt and could see on the SleepMapper app that I was getting much deeper sleep with the headband. The only reason why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars is that I am mainly a side sleeper and the integrated speakers press down on my ears and would sometimes cause me to wake to readjust them. The app is really easy to navigate and gives you very accurate information. The longer you use it, the better information you are able to get from the app. Overall, if you are looking to increase the quality of your sleep then I recommend that you consider looking into getting this Phillips Smart/Deep sleep headband.",5
1,9,1-Nov-19,"I can't lie, my quality of sleep has improved since using this. HOWEVER, it takes a while to get used to sleeping with this on your head...ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT A BACK SLEEPER. I tent to sleep on my side and stomach and this headband does not feel natural when sleeping in that position. It's not particularly UNcomfortable, but if you're not used to sleeping with something on your head, and who is, your first few nights of sleep will not be normal. However, as I said earlier, even despite the discomfort of the headband, my deep sleep was CLEARLY better than normal. If you meet the target audience for this device, I definitely recommend it. If your age is between 20 - 50, and you sleep between 5-7 hours per night on average this product very well may work for you.",3
1,10,1-Nov-19,"I was really excited to test this product out. I’ve been managing my sleep quite well but I always still wake up with very little energy, enter this headband. I tried it out for 2 weeks prior to this review so as I could start to see the results but, that did it happen. Out of the box was great, the unit is nicely made and very easy directions. The app is probably my favorite part it paired with the unit with no problem and it was fun seeing my sleep tracked but I feel there were some discrepancies with the results specifically around the time I get up. The headband feels comfortable at first not too tight but even after these few weeks it’s awkward to wear for me at night Especially the part that rests on your forehead no matter how I adjusted it. There are speakers in the ears used to send vibration noises or waves into your ears throughout the night like white noise to help you sleep which I thought would be the best part because I need white noise to sleep you barely notice the sounds but the earpiece itself in the headband is extremely uncomfortable when sleeping. Imagine sleeping your phone up to your ear every night that’s what it feels like for me. This devil has major potential but the discomfort I felt while wearing it really took away from the unit itself. I really didn’t feel a difference in my sleeping.",2
1,11,1-Nov-19,"I have many years of military service and through the years I have found it harder and harder to get good sleep. Since I have had the opportunity to wear the SmartSleep device I have found myself feeling a little more rested and alert during the following day. I’m still not sure how Phillips has figured this out, but I’m sure glad they did. If my progress continues on the following track I’m sure I’ll fell 10 years younger in no time. It’s very comfortable to wear through the night and really easy to keep clean. I’m enjoying my new found restful nights and I’m very thankful to Phillips for such a wonderful product.",7
1,12,1-Dec-19,"I don't sleep a whole lot. But I do appreciate having some data points to let me know what the real story is. I've really enjoyed having that data ever since I have been wearing a fitness tracker of some sort. But that's where the support by those devices pretty much ends. There is no way for the devices themselves to aid in improving what sleep I do get like this unit claims to do. I had high hopes for this given the $300 price point. But it just left me frustrated more than anything. The fit and feel of it is fine. Until I start moving around in my sleep. The ear piece get's removed as a result, and I gained nothing from wearing it. Then there is the possibility of the connection being lost and not capturing any data. I'd also prefer that the disposable sensors...weren't disposable. Maybe it's just me but I think this just needs to be re-engineered. My guess is that it will help those that sleep well as is and improve upon that. But for someone that sleeps very little, very light, and can move around quite a bit at night...it may not be for you and you may not get what you're hoping to get out of this. I'm all for what it's trying to achieve. But I think this just isn't quite the kit to do so.",1
1,13,1-Dec-19,"After three nights of trying the headband, I’m giving up. It’s not that’s too uncomfortable, although it’s not great. It’s that it’s a lot of setup work for very little benefit. In my case I woke up each time the stimulations started—even with ear plugs in—and when on “sensitive” mode I got no stimulations. Sometimes I also woke up with a sore spot on my ear from the sensor button. It also is now refusing to connect to its app (on iPhone) after the third night, and none of the reset and reconnect procedures in the accompanying app or Philips website work. Who knows what’s going on—it’s just not worth any more work to find out.",0
1,14,1-Dec-19,I followed the instructions over and over and over again and it doesn’t even do anything. It’s like modern day snake oil for sleep.,2
1,15,1-Dec-19,Great purchase for improving sleep quality when time is limited.,0
1,16,1-Nov-19,"Like many people, I probably don’t get enough sleep day to day. So, I was excited to see that Philips planned on making a device aimed at helping people like me. I recently picked up the SmartSleep Deep Sleep Headband and have been using for a little more than a week. Unboxing and set up was very straight forward. In the box, you get the headband, a charger, & sensors to get you started. You will need to download the SleepMapper mobile app for the initial set up and for seeing your sleep data. You’ll likely have to download an update to the headband software as well before your first nights use. Daily use involves having a fully charged headband to start and a sticky sensor that is applied on your head, behind your right ear. There is a wire connected to the headband that snaps onto the sensor. After a quick press of a power button on the front of the headband, the sensors will start trying to read your EEG signal. A series of beeps will indicate that the sensors are connecting, and a final “happy” beep to let you know that the connection is complete and the readings started. I went with the medium sized headband since Philips says it would fit 70% of people. When I tried it on the first time after on boxing, I was a little concerned I got the wrong size. I adjusted the straps as much as I could and I was able to wear it but I was still concerned it was too tight. After the first night sleep, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the headband was. I’m used to sleeping with an eye pillow, so I’m assuming that familiarity with wearing something on my head during sleep helps. The first thing I noticed after I laid down to go to sleep was the green light on the headband (yellow while charging and trying to find your EEG signal) was really really bright. Thankfully, it turns off in a minute or two. When you wake up in the morning, you have two things to do. The first is obvious, take the sticky sensor off and put it back on the plastic sheet. The second is plug the charger back into the headband. This allows you to sync your sleep data back to the mobile app. Stats that are tracked include a sleep score, time asleep, time awake, how many times you wake up during the night, your sleep routine, time to fall asleep, and sleepboost. There is also a sleep graph, which is pretty interesting to see after each night. First night, my sleep stats tell me that I fell asleep 10 minutes after putting on the headband. The graph shows the various sleep cycles, light sleep, REM sleep, and deep sleep. During deep sleep, that’s when the headband delivers sleepboost. The headband plays a specific tone to improve the quality of your deep sleep. On the graph you get a visual representation of how many times the headband is playing this tone. The first night, it played 856 times, or a total of 14 minutes of my 46 minutes of deep sleep. Over time, the single points of data can be tracked in the mobile app so you can see trends. The app also gives sleep tips if you care to read them. If you are an iOS user, you can also send your sleep data to the health app so it is in the same place as your other health related data. After a couple of nights use, I did notice that having the headband over my ears did result in some discomfort in the mornings. It happened over the weekends, when I tend to get a little more sleep than usual. I may have to adjust the placement of the headband if this continues. I will also say that Philips is accurate in that the sticky sensors will last 1-3 night before replacing. I’ve gotten 2 nights out of each sensor, but on the third night, they just wouldn’t stick. The headband comes with 30 sensors, so you’ll have 2-3 months worth before you need to purchase more. So what’s the verdict? I do actually think the headband helps. In the week + that I’ve been using it, I do feel like I’m waking up less groggy and don’t need the usual cups of coffee to be able to function. Sleep is important, even though I know I don’t get enough day to day. I guess every minute of extra deep sleep does help, even if the total time sleeping is not ideal. The product is expensive but it seems to be helping so the headband is worth it from that perspective. The Mobile app is easy to use, even if you have to plug the headband in to sync data. The headband is much more comfortable than it appears to be at first glance but can cause some ear discomfort in the AM. Overall I’m happy one week in.",1

1,19,1-Nov-19,"Pro: -App -Build material Con: -Uncomfortable to sleep with -Bulky and prevent you from sleeping on your side or stomach -Need to buy sensors The idea sounds good and I wanted to like this, but it just doesn’t work for me. It’s just way too bulky and uncomfortable for me to sleep through the night. It’s like wearing headphones and a belt around your head. I have yet to sleep more than 5 hours straight for it to record my sleep score. I either can’t fall asleep with it on or I end up waking up during the night and taking it off. The clasps on the back is bulky and push against the back of my head and I have to sleep with my head at an awkward angle. The earpiece pretty much made sleeping on my side impossible and the front of the band sticks out so I can’t sleep on my stomach. The band, which is snug on my head, shifts around during sleep. Speaking of the fit of the band, the recommended size seems off. I read the size measurements and left room to spare, and medium was the recommended size. I have to fully expand the clasps to not have them and earpieces pressing too tight. Setting up with the app was simple enough but it took me a few tries for the band to sync with the app. After each night, the band will automatically sync with the app once it’s connected to the charging cable. You don’t need the app to be running while sleeping. I can’t really comment much about the sleep tracking since I couldn’t sleep long enough to record an accurate score, but it does appear to track how long I slept, when I fell asleep, and my sleep stages accurately. To use it, you have to stick the disposable sensors on the back of your ears (a pack of 30 is included), and slide the band over your ears and attach the wire to the sensor. Power it on and it’ll beep while it detects the sensor. It takes 30 sec to a minute, and once detected, it should be set. The disposable sensors have to replaced every 1-3 days. A pack of 30 cost $30. If you can fall asleep while watching TV while wearing headphones then you might not be bothered by this headband. For me, it’s a pass.",1
1,20,1-Nov-19,"The Philips SmartSleep Headband provides valuable information to help me sleep better. The initial setup is a breeze. You download the app, follow the instructions. And you are on your way to a better sleep. When I first tried the headband, I was a bit worried that the indicator light on the headband would stay on all night and disrupt my sleep. Well, someone at Philips did their job and thought about it in advance. The light turns off, but the headband is still at work collecting sleep data. The next morning, you upload the data via the app. I found out that I am a deep sleeper, and the average hours slept. In order to use the headband, there are patches/sensors that you place behind your ear. One patch should last for a couple of uses, but I did some research on cost, and they are somewhat expensive, so take this into consideration when purchasing. Overall, the Philips SmartSleep headband has helped me improve my sleep.",2
1,21,1-Dec-19,"I was excited to try this product as I met all the specific criteria that are listed for its effective use... or so I thought. Certain age range, no sleep apnea or other sleep-related disorders, average or less than 6 hours of sleep. I had been tracking my sleep for some time via Apple Watch apps and thought it was time to do more of a deep dive to get some data on my sleep patterns/habits. That's where this product comes in. Fit: I've seen other reviewers complain about the fit of the band, I didn't think it was too terrible, but I also made sure to get the specific size for my head circumference (I measured first). I also have short hair so wearing something on my head to sleep wasn't as much of an issue for me. The sensors are another discussion entirely. Materials and construction feel solid and like something I could wear on a consistent basis and it will last. Issues: The whole idea behind this product is for the 2 sensors in the band, and the behind the ear sensor to be in place properly. When the app detects you are in a deep sleep state and you might be exiting it, it plays sounds to continue your deep sleep. Quality over quantity for sleepers who get less than the recommended 8 hours, is the way I understand it. Issue number one was connectivity. I couldn't get a solid week out of this thing without at least one night or more having not enough data to determine your sleep score. This also left me wondering if it was working on those nights, or did it not have enough data to boost my sleep? Issue number two is the behind the ear sensors. These are ""disposable"" and often didn't stick effectively for me, or had to be readjusted and then would put uncomfortable pressure on the bone behind my ear where you place it, as I'm primarily a side sleeper. The initial unit comes with a decent number of sensors, and I did attempt to reuse them a few nights, possibly contributing to the loss of data. A refill of those sensors is about $1 each. Overall: In the end, I didn't feel like I was seeing a significant improvement to my sleep. I ended up reviewing the sleep data from the app with my dr, along with some other metrics, and he referred me to a sleep study. The data and the experience of using the deep sleep band definitely contributed to this journey and helped me along the way. I hoped that this technology would be the sleep solution for me, and I think if you meet the criteria, it could be. TLDR: Specifically designed for a set of sleep criteria/metrics. Achieving better rest seems worth it though.",2
1,22,1-Dec-19,"As someone who has a hard time falling asleep, I have searched and tried non-medicated solutions to end my nocturnal habit. This lead me to trying out this Philips Headband. Before trying this, there are two things you have to do. First is read the list of diagnoses that this will not be effective on.. (i.e. if you have sleep apnea.. etc), Second is to consider what size of a headband you need. Large or medium. I first tried the medium since I fell within the circumference measurement which is about maybe at the high end of medium. I figure I could adjust it enough however at the widest setting the sliders felt bulging at the center. It wasn't bad at first but a few nights later I felt it was just too snug as I either woke up to take it off or I unconsciously removed it. This offset the results. I did exchange and got the large headband and it felt much more comfortable. The only thing about being too comfortable is it might be too loose that I would lose connection. Set up is easy, There is a video to follow in the website or you tube. The only thing to note is the initial firmware update takes a while to do.. ~ 10-20 min. Another thing that you might want to consider is that the sensors that come with it will wore out. One sensor can get you 3 days worth of use, meaning you dispose it after it doesn't stick anymore (kinda like having contact lens, you use it then throw them away after a few uses). Overall, I do believe it helps me stay asleep when I got it to work after all the adjustments and learning process. Pros: A sleep aide; App based; numeric scale interpretation Cons: price; disposable sensors - meaning you have to PURCHASE more when you ran out.",1
1,23,1-Nov-19,"he good: - sleep tracking seems to be accurate and very detailed - app is well designed and intuitive to use the bad: - comfort. For me, the single biggest negative here is that I simply cannot sleep while wearing something like this on my head. The size adjustment clasp is on the back, preventing me from laying on my back. The upper forward part of the “helmet” has sort of a bulge to it, making it difficult for me to sleep on my stomach. Ultimately the only way to get my head into a comfortable position left my neck somewhat twisted and awkward. Over a week’s time I tried every different position, and none offered anything more comfortable. - sensor stickers - I’m not sure why, but because of the use of disposable sensor stickers, which of course you have to purchase after you go through the included ones (30 are actually included, which is nice) this ultimately feels like a subscription service model to sleep. I know I’m nitpicking here but for something so expensive, to have to continue paying after the fact for stickers leaves a bad taste in my mouth. - I personally didn’t notice much of an improvement in my sleep quality, admittedly probably mostly due to fitting/comfort issues. overall: I’m sure this will work well for some people, just not for me. The headband seems well constructed and the app is good, but ultimately I don’t think I can personally continue to wear something like this until it’s less intrusive physically.",2
1,24,1-Nov-19,"Interesting concept, lightweight, but not for me",0
1,25,1-Nov-19,"The Philips SmartSleep Deep Sleep Headband helped me to get a better night sleep. It comes in a couple sizes, and I used the large size. Using it was pretty simple. First, I attached one of the sensors from the pack of sensors that comes with the headband behind my ear. Next, I put the headband on and connected it to that sensor. After that, I turned it on and just fall asleep. It works by making tones that you don't really hear because they are sounding when you are asleep and are designed to elongate the deep sleep period of nightly rest. In the morning, I charged it and then viewed my sleep stats on the SleepMapper app on my phone. I found the headband to be comfortable and not particularly noticeable after a few days. I have used it for a little over a week now and I do feel more refreshed when I wake up. The length of my sleep hasn't increased much, but the sleep seems to do me more good. I also feel less sleepy during the day, which is a nice feeling. It did not make any drastic changes to my sleep, but I could understand how it could for other people. I would recommend this item to others; it made a difference for me! If you are thinking about purchasing this item, here are some guidelines from the instructions to see if the product could be right for you: • I am 18 years or older. • I typically fall asleep within 30 minutes of trying to fall asleep. • I typically sleep at least five (5) hours, but less than seven (7) hours a night on work or school nights. • I have not been diagnosed with a sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, insomnia). • I don’t regularly wake up during the night and have trouble falling back asleep (>30 minutes). • I do not regularly use medications or alcohol to help me fall or stay asleep. • I do not have hearing impairment preventing me from hearing 80 decibels. A person’s slow wave amplitude naturally reduces with age. SmartSleep will not be effective if you have low amplitude slow waves which occurs after age 50. SmartSleep is recommended for people age 50 and under.",5
1,26,1-Nov-19,"I was very interested to try this product out as I'm one to get limited amount of hours of sleep at night. I was hoping this would be a great device to improve the quality of that, but ultimately, I just couldn't get used to sleeping with it on. The unboxing and initial setup was fun. Powering on the device really lights up a dark room, so be careful not to turn it on pointed in the direction of any eyeballs. The light does turn off after 60 seconds. The device requires you to place a sticky sensor behind your right ear to help the headband collect an ECG Signal. The sticky sensors held their position well, but did leave behind trace residue that I could feel, even after showering some days. The headband wasn't crazy restrictive, but did feel slightly uncomfortable. The best position I found was laying on your back, but if you can get used to sleeping on a speaker module, you can sleep on your side as well. I felt side sleeping was risking the headband falling off though, and tried to sleep solely on my back. In all of my attempt at amazing deep sleep, I never did achieve ""sleep boost"" that the device was supposed to help with in the 2 weeks I tried this out. I found a few times waking up out of a dream sleep which is unusual for me, and a few nights ending up ripping the headband off a couple hours into the sleep and being disappointed in the morning that there wasn't enough sleep data collected. I was also surprised that you have to plug the device into a charger to get it to sync the data back to your phone. (Maybe this is a way to make sure the device gets charged for each night?) Overall, I loved the idea and premise behind it, but I just couldn't get used to it. For someone else wanting to take the plunge, I'd definitely give it a try, but make sure you're not a very sensitive, picky sleeper.",2
1,27,1-Nov-19,"First off, I ordered an extra large and the headband was too small. The size adjustment in the back gives ample room for large melons but there is no adjustment in the front so the speakers that go over your ears were always slightly in front of my ears instead of directly over them. This made it uncomfortable when turned on my side which is how I normally sleep. The sleep tracking app was interesting but beyond that, what good does it really do to know when I was asleep and how many times I woke up in the night, which according to the graph, was a lot. I never heard anything but the app told me the headband delivered a ""sleep boost"" anywhere from 8 to 30+ times every night which is supposedly a white noise or something with a message saying the boost delivered a corresponding % improvement in sleep quality. It seems a little bogus since it always lists this boost as an improvement even on the nights I slept the worst. I'm a bit of a warm sleeper and occasionally wake up a little damp on my head, neck and shoulders which complicates the use of the SmartSleep since as far as I can tell it is not washable. Another gripe is that location has to be enabled to use the app and connect to the headband. Why in the world is that necessary? Bottom line it's not overly comfortable, effectiveness is questionable, what it actually does while you're sleeping is a bit mysterious and you can't clean it. As stated previously, the sleep graph is kind of cool but I saw no improvement in sleep quality. That plus the rather high cost is a no thanks from me.Brand response from Philips Consumer Care",2
1,28,1-Nov-19,"Upon first coming across this product I thought I would give it a try as it promised, more restful sleep. I don’t have consistent sleep cycles and have a desire to have more regulates sleeping habits. The headband itself was comfortable and easy to sleep on, although it felt awkward the first few nights I used it. The app allows for easy and intuitive settings and the device itself is nearly ready to go out of the box. To be honest I don’t know if it was just me but, I didn’t notice any difference in the way I sleep without it. I would have to pass on this product.",1
1,29,1-Nov-19,"I wish that the Philips - SmartSleep Deep Sleep Headband lived up to its promise. I've had sleep issues for years and this device showed real promise based on my research. But after a week's use, I have only gained 7 minutes of additional sleep, and still cannot stay asleep for longer than 2 hour incriments. What's worse, in my case at least, the tone that is supposed to induce more restful sleep actually woke me up instead. Finally the Headband is uncomfortably tight and my hat size is only 7 1/8. I dunno, maybe I'm the exception not the rule. Cheers!",1

2,2,5-Feb-20,"This little device works. I seldom leave reviews so keep this in mind. I purchased, charged up and gave it a shot. I don't sleep with a shirt, so I adjusted strap as shown in instructions. The strap is soft so it didn't feel uncomfortable. I turned the device on and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling like I tossed and turned a little but I was refreshed. The next morning I cycled through the results. It said it got me to flip 8% of the time it asked me (just vibrates), total sleep time was 8.1, and 7 hours on my back. The 2nd night was 55% of the time it worked, spending maybe 5 hours on the back. I skipped a night and 4th night had it up in the 83% and only snoring maybe 1.3 hours. That morning I felt I had so much energy. I skipped a night again and 6th night I was 95% sleeping. I couldn't believe how this device works. Now I'm almost 99-100% all the time. I've got a lot more energy, even having vivid dreams. I know people want bluetooth sync but just write down your numbers like I did. At first you have to charge it each night but lately it lasts me several days, only because it doesn't have to signal you as long. If you are a back snorer, just want a little more energy buy this.",2
2,3,20-Feb-20,"I've had this device for two weeks and I have gone from 2 hours of back sleeping to under 15 minutes each night. I also use this in conjunction with a CPAP and my AHI index has gone from 2.5 to under 1 (I have positional sleep apnea) - first time I have had nights with 0 apneas. The device is extremely comfortable I even forget its there.
I am very pleased more with this item, but didn't give it a full five stars because of two reasons: 1) The price should really be about $100 for what you get for this device
2) The strap loosens as you sleep and if you don't readjust it nightly you will not feel the vibrations and will return to back sleeping - I have found a gap of 3-4 inches is about right before you secure the strap. I am going to have my CPAP put in test mode and see if this device along with mouth taping (which dropped my AHI from 6 to 2.5) is enough to treat my sleep apnea... Will update the review with the results. Update: After sharing my results sleep training results with my doctor. We made the decision to retest my apnea in concert with this device and mouth taping. My results came back as an AHI of 1! I'm not officially graduated from my CPAP. I couldn't be happier because after months of trying I still hadn't adjusted to it.

If you have positional sleep apnea and are interested in doing something like this I would recommend you talk to your doctor. They may be more willing to work with the Philips NightBalance, which is the FDA approved medical device to treat positional sleep apnea.",1

I have positional sleep apnea and I’ve tried many solutions, tennis ball t-shirts, blocks of wood, piles of books, small backpacks.. anything to stop me from turning onto my back. This is the only thing that works perfectly, gently, precisely. It is comfortable, adaptive and unobtrusive and after the first week in which it learns and responds to your way of using it (brilliant) I now have zero hours of back sleep and %100 response rate to the very gentle buzz that it delivers when it senses that I am turning over. It does not even wake me completely, just suggests.. and I follow. Some reviewers have said that if you sleep on you stomach it ceases to work after that. Not my experience at all. I regularly sleep on my stomach at intervals and it works perfectly after that every single time. If it didn’t I’d send it back immediately. Battery charge is quick and very long.

2,5,29-Feb-20,"I sometimes half sleep on my stomach, like I’ll hug my pillow and half of my chest will be on it, and half on the bed. Or sometimes I’ll full on sleep on my stomach. Turns out this isn’t great for that, both because it protrudes from your body and therefore feels like sleeping on a box of tic tacs, and because doing so seemingly stops the gyroscope from working the rest of the night. I’ve tested this to confirm. After flipping onto my chest, it won’t vibrate anytime after that, even if you subsequently flip into your back. So if this doesn’t let you sleep on your back, and sleeping on your stomach deactivates it for the rest of the night, that means your only option is to sleep in your side. That’s not as foolproof as I think it needs to be given that the whole premise of the device is that your behavior is unconscious at night. So, if you’re ok with only ever sleeping on your side for the whole night, this is probably a good product.",1

You wear this around your torso and it buzzes when you are sleeping on your back, which is often the position that causes snoring. It is an electronic elbow in your side. It let's you fall asleep, and then starts to buzz you (lightly at first) when you are in your back too long. The product packaging says it learns as it goes, but not sure what that means. This wakes you up, reminding you to turn on your side. For the first week, it really disrupted my sleep. Now, it still shakes me to a lighter sleep but I now respond without waking fully up. The main downside is that my brain, at night, is waiting for the vibration, so sometimes my sleep is more shallow.Has it been beneficial? Not sure yet. It does wake me up and stops/prevents positional snoring, so my spouse is happy. But I think my sleep quality has taken a hit.",17

I know I snore, and I try to sleep on my side, but of course, sometimes I roll back over onto my back, and the snoring resumes. I’ve been experimenting with this band while sleeping by myself, and it does wake me up after I’ve rolled onto my back. It actually scared the bejeezus out of me the first couple of times it zapped me. After that, I knew what was happening and didn’t wake up in a panic. In fact, I don’t think I have really fully woken up the last few times – it appears I now accept it as a nudge to roll over, and I do that without being fully conscious. I like the fact that it waits 30 minutes before going into zap mode, because I do like to fall asleep on my back initially, and then roll over on my side. I can’t attest to whether it’s working on my snoring, but I never wake up on my back anymore, so it clearly is keeping me from sleeping on my back. And that’s what it’s supposed to do.",7

But it’s not for all. Read on to learn why:If your partner (or you!) snores while sleeping with the back against the bed, this device gives an electronic but silent buzzy encouragement to move to the side. It side sleeping stops the snoring issue, this new vibrating Phillips device is worth any price and is a Godsend so you’ll both sleep more soundly.

2,12,21-Nov-19,"This is an effective anti-snoring device only for those who snore only when lying on their back. That applies to me so this worked very well for me. However, this device only fires when the user is solidly on their back and a partial turn to the side will deactive the vibrational warning to turn over. Philips says this works for 86% of the people, and it did work well for me. But before buying make sure you are a back snorer.

The key problem with this device is that it wakes you up to get you to turn. I am quick to get back to sleep so this was not a problem for me. But for light sleepers who have trouble getting to sleep, this may be a key problem that will prevent the use of this device after a few nights. Amazon has a generous return policy so keep all the materials in the box in preparation for returning this item should it simply prevent you from sleeping.

The instructions are great and this gadget does exactly what it claims to do, prevent you from sleeping on your back. It may prevent you from sleeping at all however, which is why I gave it only four stars. But for me it worked after a few nights of adjustment.

2,13,13-Nov-19,"The Philips Smartsleep Snoring Relief Band is a pretty simple device - it detects when you are sleeping on your back and gently vibrates you to alert/coax you to rollover to your side. It even gets more aggressive in the vibration patterns the longer you wear it.

The first couple of nights I wore it it did wake me up (scared the cr@! out of me the first time!) - was so wide awake after shock therapy that I couldn't fall back asleep for a while. A couple of days later I got used to it vibrating and made the conscious choice to ignore it. So, it could have worked. It also doesn't help that I snore while sleeping on my side too.

So in summary - it does what is advertises, it's just not as effective in my situation. If you sleep light enough that this can wake you and you choose to roll over (and not snore) then this may be for you.",3

Anyways, I subscribe to Philips products emails and this came up so with the 30 day trial I thought to give it a whirl. By the time it arrived and got used to using it, I probably used it a week till my husband was off on a trip which then I stopped wearing it. When he returned he was like, ""Where's that thing you got? I am not sleeping well."" I thought, ""Oh was it helping?"", he says, ""Yeah, it's like I don't have to wake up to make you roll to your side all night long. It seems to get you to move before I need to do anything."" So, back on with it. I am still not used to the output of info but I notice yeah, I can't sleep on my back really ever. I do to fall asleep on my back and I will sleep on my back in the morning a bit after stopping it to get my fill. For the most part I am a side and stomach sleeper. I don't notice it ever turning off for sleeping on my stomach. I have slight memories of it waking me over and over if I try to sleep on my back which is annoying. Once it was waking me at awkward angles in my sleep and it was because it had slipped to the side and was not tight enough to be centered right in the middle of the chest. If I didn't have good sleep it's usually that I've tossed about 75+ times. Good nights, I barely remember it waking me and I've tossed about 20 times. In the end, I'm doing this for my husband and he is happy. So, though it is pricey, I do think it is worth it. GOOD Sleep is important for everyone. I have been using it for about 5-6 weeks now and do really recommend this to anyone in the same boat as me. I think your partner will appreciate it.

2,18,29-Feb-20,"Several years ago, I was prescribed a CPAP device after a sleep study showed I needed one. After trying every mask in the marketplace, I just couldn’t deal with it. Not being able to sleep with something on my face made it worthless equipment. While it’s still very early in my usage (5 days), so far the Phillips Smartsleep band seems like a miracle. In the last five days, I’ve fallen asleep faster (not sure why), I’ve slept through the night (unusual for me) and I’ve awakened more refreshed. Last night, for the first time, I noticed the vibration nudge to move me back to sleeping on my side.
The band is comfortable, not really noticeable and stays in place. The on/off function is tricky and I’m still not always sure I have it in the sleep mode unless I stay awake for 30 minutes on my back to see if it does the vibration nudge. After the first 30 minutes, it vibrates every time I move to sleeping on my back.
I wish the sleep mode indicator was more apparent and the power off function, too. A Bluetooth link to a smart phone app would be extremely helpful. I have charged it only once, when it first arrived. There supposedly is a low battery indicator but all the readings are difficult to see. Again a phone app would be ideal.

That said, I am grateful for this innovation and will continue to use it as is because it’s working for me. Highly recommended for side sleepers that only snore on their backs.",0

2,20,20-Nov-19,"I had a pretty difficult time initially getting this sleep band to work. It was a little confusing at first because it was hard to tell whether or not it was powered on. That's because the sensor behaves in a similar fashion when you power it on and off. I was looking for an obvious indicator that it was powered on. There was a little white dot in the upper left corner of the digital display that I thought was a power indicator but it was actually the indicator for the adaptation phase. Eventually, I discovered that two dashes appear when you power it on. It's not the most obvious indicator at first but I got used to it after the first few uses.

Usage is pretty straightforward. You attach the band to your torso above the abdomen and beneath the breasts. The band fits me comfortably and I have a large frame. I don't really even notice it during wear aside from the vibrations. When the sensor is first powered on for each session, it allows thirty minutes to fall asleep in any position. Once the thirty minutes elapses, the sensor will begin vibrating whenever the wearer lays on their back. The vibrating stops when the wearer shifts to a side sleeping position. The sensor starts in an adaptation phase during the first seven uses. During this phase, the vibration progressively intensifies with each subsequent session. Over time, the vibration patterns will change to prevent the wearer from adapting to the sensation and eventually ignoring the alerts. If a wearer wakes up during the night for a bathroom visit or other reasons, the sensor goes into a standby mode until it detects normal sleeping position again. If the sensor is powered off, it will resume the current session as long as it's powered back on within two hours. Sessions can last up to twelve hours. Once a session ends, the digital display will show the response rate to the alerts, total time spent in bed and total time spent sleeping on the back. The data only shows statistics from the most recent sleep session. Historical data is not available.

There aren't really a lot of options as far as use. As far as I can tell, there is no way to disable the adaptive phase or adjust vibration intensity other than resetting the sensor. There is no companion app and no way to see data beyond the most recent sleep session. I don't personally find it to be a big deal as it is marketed as a snore relief device rather than a sleep monitoring device.

The Philips snore relief does work as described. It definitely improves the quality of sleep for my wife because she no longer has to listen to me endlessly saw wood all night long. The jury is still out on whether or not it improves the quality of my sleep. I can't see how any device that repeatedly stuns you throughout the night can improve sleep but maybe it does somehow. I don't feel extra refreshed or well-rested in the mornings but I also don't feel extra tired nor like I didn't get adequate rest in the mornings. Even if it's a push on whether or not it improves my sleep quality, the fact that my wife no longer has to suffer and repeatedly elbow me throughout the night is one major plus. The one thing I wouldn't recommend is using this for obstructive sleep apnea. That's an entirely different issue and should be treated by a medical professional. I'd recommend this more for light snorers who don't suffer from apnea.",4
2,21,29-Nov-19,"The device is small and feel high tech. The color is pleasant to the eyes with light gray color. The body strap is made from very bungee soft material that feels like expensive cloth. The strap is easy to put on once the adjustment on my upper body is set properly. The instructions are easy to follow and the information shown on the device is easy to read from the LCD screen.I used it for a few nights now and it took me two nights to get used to it. The strap was a little annoying on the first night because my mind was thinking about that all the time. And I didn’t wear the strap properly. I wore it too high, it should have been below my nipples, not above my nipples. So, it was not very comfortable because it obstructs my breathing. I also felt paranoid about the vibrations before I fell asleep. 2nd night was better because I wore the strap properly and felt more comfortable. I got used to the idea of it went around below my chest and I just fell asleep as usual. The sensor worked as designed and it woke me up gently when my belly is facing the ceiling. I just turned to my side with my eyes closed and I was still half asleep for a few times that I could remember. The 3rd night became completely natural for me. My body got used to the drill and I didn’t even remember the device made me turn to my side at all. Based on the information log on the device, it had alerted me for 5 time, but my mind just simply didn’t have that memory during my sleep.I believe the device works for me because my body is now trained by it after the 2nd night. My partner thanked me for trying this new device for our better night sleep, because I didn’t need to be woken up by someone anymore. Even it didn’t work, my partner appreciated my effort of exploring solution. I also like the information log that records how I sleep and how many times I turn during the night. The rechargeable batteries is great so far, it still has a lot of charge left after 3 nights of 7-hour sleep session. The body strap is soft and easy to clean. 2-yr warranty back by Phillips is a great peace of mind. Hope the rechargeable battery will have at least 2 years of service life.",3
2,22,11-Nov-19,"I do not have sleep apnea, but my spouse says I do snore - albeit softly - quite frequently. The ""Philips Smartsleep Snoring Relief Band, Anti Snoring Device for Quieter Nights"" seemed to be a good solution. Using a vibration, it is supposed to cue the wearer to turn on their side when they begin snoring. It did not work for me because of a shoulder injury, I cannot sleep on my side. Further, I can sleep through thunderstorms, crying children, and being poked in the ribs in an attempt to wake me.The ""Philips Smartsleep Snoring Relief Band, Anti Snoring Device for Quieter Nights"" may work for those who are able to sleep on their side and who are not able to sleep through the apocalypse.",4
2,23,28-Dec-19,"From Him:
Hello, I am the snorer. I am the one being woken up several times a night by a frustrated wife who just wants to sleep. I have tried mouth guards, pills, and Breath Right strips and nothing has solved this. Until now.
It turns out that I am a back snorer. The mouth guard helped while on my side, but not my back. This device vibrates when you roll onto your back, prompting you to roll over and stop snoring.
It has a training period of one week, so you gradually adjust to this. For the first seven nights the number of vibrations increase each night until the 8th night, when it vibrates every time you are on your back. This sensor also detects and learns the needed vibration level to get you to respond.
The band that holds it on is comfortable and adjustable.

From Her:
This is amazing! I can now sleep an entire night through without having to roll him over even once. Our bedroom is peaceful and quiet, and I can get good rest.
We have tried everything over the last 12 years, and this is the only thing that really solved it. He sleeps with both the mouth guard and this device, and goes the entire night with sleeping.
This is worth every penny.",2
2,24,16-Nov-19,"First, it is a weird product. How one wears it and how it works is odd. Second, the instructions are EPIC! Best instructions with any product possibly ever. Third, my wife is the one I got this for... Not that I don't snore, but she really snores when on her back... I cannot sleep through it.

The first night I noticed a difference. The second night I noticed an even bigger difference. The third night, a huge difference. However; on the fourth night she finds the buzzing waking to a distraction. I know I have to read those great instructions much better to learn how I can adjust the response to snoring to be a little less jarring.

I will update this review at that point. Suffice it to say, it works, is high quality in every aspect, but the screen could certainly be more instructive to help with adjustments and tailoring the response to each person. It is very comfortable to wear, so pending proper adjustments, I think this will be a true long term help to my sleep.

This is no toy... This is a medical quality device that just needs a little more intuitive screen to bring it to five stars for me.",2
2,25,13-Jan-20,"I've been using the Philips SmartSleep snoring relief band for about 8 weeks. This little gadget is very comfortable to wear, I can barely tell it's on. It's VERY effective! After using this for a while I can now say that I sleep better and feel better each morning.

Be aware that the first week you use this, you will not notice much. The device goes through an ""adaptation phase"" and won't vibrate each time you are on your back. By the 8th night, it will work each time you are on your back. After that, your body will adjust and you'll notice it less and automatically stay on your side more. At least that's how it has worked for me.

I need to turn it on before going to bed and turn it off in the morning, it's not automatic. The device records how often, in percentages, that I roll to my side, as well as how many hours I sleep on my side and on my back. The data is clear and easy to read. 

Each charge lasts about a week. The band is very soft against my skin.  It's an easy habit to put this on right before I take off my eyeglasses and crawl under the covers. It's making a difference for me as well as my family members who had to listen to me snore.",0
2,26,18-Dec-19,"This Philips SmartSleep wearable device is a small and lightweight gadget to help reduce positional snoring. It vibrates as you turn on your back whether you’re snoring or not, and it stops vibrating when you roll back onto your side. It monitors your position, but does NOT monitor your snoring. There’s a ramp up period for a week, but after that it continuously vibrates in more aggressive sequences whenever you end up on your back.
From testing this out, I can see that this SleepSmart device has the potential to reduce snoring for positional back snorers. But it requires both the ability and willingness to side sleep all night because any time you end up on your back (after the first week) it aggressively vibrates nonstop until returning to your side.
I am a positional snorer and during the ramp up process where the device vibrates less I responded sometimes and turned on my side without feeling overly disturbed. It did disturb my sleep, however, once it ramped up as sleeping on my side all night is tough on my hips and back and I couldn’t even get a short period on my back as it constantly vibrates. But I can see that this device may work for someone who can side sleep all night without pain. I recommend reading the manual on the Philips site to understand how it works and who is a good candidate.

This SmartSleep device does function exactly as described in terms of how and when it vibrates. It also gives feedback on the % of time you respond to the vibration, hours in bed and hours back sleeping. The feedback is interesting and seems accurate based on results I got testing the device while awake, though I can’t be sure whether the % response rate is affected at all by normal tossing and turning while asleep.

The device and belt seem high quality, and this device is easy to operate. It needs to be charged (wall adapter and cable included) and then fits inside a slit in a wearable grey belt. The belt is soft, smooth and feels comfortable against my skin, and it’s highly adjustable in length and also stretchy so it should fit almost anyone. I was just a little aware of it on my torso the first couple nights and didn’t notice it after that.

Overall, I think this is a quality device that may work for some people, but it has limitations so that it won’t work for everyone. Especially with the 30-day trial period, I’d recommend it to positional back snorers who have the ability to side sleep and be comfortable as it’s really about getting someone used to side sleeping to stop back snoring. I think it may have worked for me if I didn’t have chronic pain that makes me too uncomfortable if on my side all night. 4 stars.",0
2,27,1-Dec-19,"Ok. I got this one for me and my wife. I am the one got to wear it, since she is the one that usually has to put up with my snoring... :(
That being said, the good news is that it does what it says it does... when you sleep on your back it nudges you to sleep on your side. The bad news is that it appears that sleeping on my back is not the reason I snore... According to my wife, I am still as loud as a fork in a food processor. On a side note, I have a bad back, and sleeping on the side is good for it. This one has helped me a lot with that.
All and all, good product, just not for my snoring...
If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below. Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!",1
2,28,4-Dec-19,"It is important to understand what this device is. It doesn't fix snoring, and does nothing to affect air flow in your nose or mouth. What it does is nudge you while you are sleeping if you end up on your back. If you are a snorer who snores a lot worse while on your back, this might help. If your snoring is the same whether on your back or side, it will not help.

The band is easy to use. You slip the band around your torso (it is easy to adjust) and then slide the device into a pouch on the band. Once the device is turned on (you do this before sleeping) it will give you half an hour to fall asleep before becoming ""active"" - when active, if it detects you are on your back, it will gently vibrate to nudge you to roll onto your side. If you don't move it will vibrate harder. That's really it! I found that the buzzing didn't wake me up (at least enough to be conscious) and did stay on my side more at night. I use an app to track snoring and I didn't see any dramatic difference with the band, although my snoring level is pretty erratic anyways.

This is certainly worth trying especially if you know you snore badly on your back.",0
2,29,18-Nov-19,"I tried this, it didn't make much of an impact. I don't snore often, and usually sleep on my side, but I thought maybe it would help me sleep better if it kept me on my side.

I'm with one other reviewer on the results the first time - I freaked out. And woke up more than I would've preferred. But once it wasn't a ""new"" thing the next night or two, despite increasing levels, I guess my body just accepted the input and ignored it now.

If you're a light sleeper, this may help, but if you are not, the effectiveness may be considerably lessened...",1
2,30,11-Apr-20,"My partner is a snorer on his back, and it wakes me up and it will stop for awhile after I kick him, then cycles again. I thought this may be the perfect answer! It would do the kicking job instead of me! The first night it didn’t do a thing, and I figured out in the morning we did not turn it on correctly, so be sure to do that! After that it did it’s job - he did remember feeling it once or twice during the night, although did not report it actually kept him awake or bothered him much. I’ve definitely noticed that I don’t get woken up! At first he was leery about wearing something strapped on his chest that shocked him (which it doesn’t!) but got over that right away when realizing how soft and non-binding the strap is. It probably is a bit overpriced, but for someone who used to wake up to snoring every night, it’s priceless!",0
2,31,7-Jan-20,"This is a very simple item that will vibrate when you are on your back sleeping - to assist in preventing snoring. There is no fancy app to tell you about your sleep routine or anything - it simply vibrates when you are on your back - so that you will turn over and hopefully not snore.

My husband found it to be comfortable enough - by the third night he said he never even felt like he was wearing it. He found and I found that it did help him to turn over on his side and I found that I had a better nights rest because he wasn't snoring all night long!

Great Instructions

3,1,4-Jan-00,"I've been using the app for a week now so these are my initial thoughts so far. First off, this is just a paid yearlong subscription to an app. But don't expect to just instantly get a downloadable code. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when my subscription shipped. As other reviews stated, it's just a box too big for a small journal, and the printed code with QR for the actual subscription. I haven't really used the journal, but more than half of it is more like a book with tips and info about sleep. As for the app, when first starting out, you have to go through an assessment period of a week to track your sleep. I was excited for this since I do have some sleep issues and wear my Fitbit more for sleep tracking than step counting. Great thing about this app is that it connects to my Fitbit and uses the tracked data! Not so great thing is that it doesn't always sync with my Fitbit. Out of 7 nights tracked, it only synced up with my Fitbit on 4 of those nights, and 1 night the app failed to track my sleep at all. There are tips on making sure your tracker syncs, but they're not very straightforward. The app seems to want to complete the daily assessment as soon as you're done sleeping, so if you don't sync the Fitbit to the Fitbit app right away, it'll complete the night's stats before getting the Fitbit data. It would be nice if there was an option to manually sync Fitbit data or at least have the app not complete the night's tracking before making sure it synced it. Finally the assessment. It honestly didn't tell me much more than I already knew. Listening to the recordings it made of me snoring is creepy and not something I enjoyed hearing. It also asked me what time I'd prefer to wake up in order to set up a challenge to help me improve my sleep, which I set, but then when it gave me my challenge it used my assessment's average wake time instead. On the plus side, I do like the challenges, it sort of ""gamify's"" sleep, and I do think this aspect will help me get better with going to bed at a decent time and trying to get a full night's sleep. I'm going to keep using it since its only been a week and I have the year subscription, so hopefully it ends up helping me. At the very least it's something that can help you stay accountable to make sure you go to sleep at a reasonable time, or not eat before bed, or try to wake up at the same time. I'll probably turn off the sound recordings though, I already have my wife to tell me how bad I snored the night before!",1
3,2,4-Jan-00,"I had high hopes for this program. I tracked my sleep for over a week and the program said error after my final day of completing the tracking after the minimum week of tracking. First off the interaction between my Galaxy watch and my Android phone was not easy to follow. Second, it drained my Galaxy watch like crazy. Third it did not give me my assessment report after I tracked my sleep for over a week. I would not recommend this product at this time. There are too many bugs with the program at least on Android platform.",1
3,3,4-Jan-00,"Before this app I thought that tossing and turning for 2 hours every night before I fall asleep was just the way it is for me. It turns out that doing a simple program (simple but not easy) can actually help. I have tried dozens of solutions before this and was skeptical. The program helped me see that I can fall asleep easily if I follow simple guidelines. It took a few weeks and was worth it, I finally look forward to going to bed. The journal in the box is a nice addition to the app.",0
3,4,4-Jan-00,"--- Installation --- The installation of this app is effortless. A card is included in the app with a QR code that will direct you to the App Store (iOS) to download and install the app. The QR code is your redemption code as well. ---FEATURES--- The key feature of this app is that it will monitor your sleeping habits through a series of surveys and several monitoring features such as using your phone’s microphone listening for snoring and can be connected with your Apple Watch to detect movement during sleep as well as average heartbeat with heart rest. All data tracked can be exported to a CVS file to show your doctor. ---PERFORMANCE--- The performance of the app is only as good you track your own habits. At first, you must track your sleeping habits for a full week. Every night, you can answer a survey and watch 1-3 minute videos that educate you on what makes for a better sleep. I did all pre-surveys in 15 minutes the first night and I watched all the videos in about another 15, also the same night. They are very insightful, and I became more conscious of what I was doing during the day that eventually led to a bad night's rest. After that first day, there is a very short survey asking about your day nightly. That takes less than a minute to answer and it is based on a sliding scale. Some questions you answer are: How relaxed your day was (on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the most stressful); What activities did you do 3 hours before bedtime (exercise, drink caffeine, eat, or watch a screen for longer than 15 minutes); Were you prone to sleeping during the day unwillingly; How many naps did you take during the day. By answering these questions, you start to realize a pattern of your bad habits, but ultimately, it is up to you to correct them. There were only two instances that I had trouble with the app. One of them is when my Apple Watch ran out of battery while I slept. The app refused to stop tracking when I awoke. However, I placed my Apple Watch on the charger and in about a minute, the watch sent the data to the phone and the app resumed as normal. The other is that the app itself has the option to write daily notes and a dream catcher diary. However, when you click on the white dialogue box to type, the keyboard covers what you are typing and there is no way to tell if you are writing something wrong. Those issues will probably be corrected with updates, but it’s something to note. Alternatively, the box that you buy at Best Buy will have a manual diary in it for you to use if that’s your preferred method. ---EXPECTATIONS--- The product meets my expectations. I have used other apps before to correct my bad habits, such as unhealthy eating, which helped me lose weight. This app is no different in the sense that it is only helpful if you plan to commit to the recommendations based on your honest feedback provided to the app. Ater the week’s initial assessment, there are other videos that pop up that you can watch at your leisure to help you. You will also be able to activate weekly challenges that can help you maintain better sleeping habits until you new normal is a proper preparation for bed. I assumed I wasn’t snoring when I slept, but the app proved to me that I was doing so daily, as you can replay the times that you snored during the night. By the 6th night, I was able to have a snoreless rest. By the seventh night, I began to dream again and I was able to recollect it. ---VALUE--- The price for the app in terms of value is worth the investment only if you plan to commit yourself to the program. That app won’t make you automatically fall asleep. It helps you record your bad habits and makes suggestions for corrected behavior. ---APPROVAL--- I highly recommend this product for people who have ever been successful taking an online college course where the expectation was for you to do your own time management because you were busy in other aspects of life. Most of us don’t have time to go to a sleep clinic. If you have ever had trouble sleeping, this could be a potential solution that you’ve been seeking for.",2
3,5,4-Jan-00,Don’t get me wrong it’s very good but I have seen other cheaper apps that work the same and provide the same or more data. It takes 5 nights for the app to complete an evaluation assessment. Unfortunately even though I did exactly what the app said and used it for 5 nights to get my assessment report. It still wouldn’t unlock the report for me? Now that’s pretty sad and the reason for the 3 stars. Makes no sense why they wouldn’t work after I complete 5 nights of sleep with the Sleeprate app. It has cool features like if you pair it with your Apple Watch it records your heartbeat throughout the night and puts it on a graph. It records when you snore so you can replay and listen to it. I have to say it’s not very automatic you have to do a lot of manual things before and after you go to bed to use this app. Like I said many other options out there that are cheaper and do the same or more.,1
3,6,4-Jan-00,"I’m not sure if it is that Philips put this in stores and I have no doubt the professionals who developed this mean well but it felt like paying Philips to do homework. I honestly am still trying to wrap my head around the journaling, application statistics and activity monitor components. So I have had to track my patterns and habits to the send data to a group of professionals who will send me more data on how to practice better sleep. All the while awaiting those results I am left journaling and given hints, tips and tricks to a night for better sleep. I am sorry but this was a hard Miss for Philips and while all the tools in the Sleep family that recently came out look great. This has just left me confused.",1
3,7,4-Jan-00,"The Philips Smart Sleep app and included notebook have helped me to figure out some issues I have with my sleep habits. I am in my second week with the program which is where you start to work on suggestions from the results. The app includes a year long subscription which include videos, tips, alarms and tracks noises during your sleep (snoring…). As for starting off in the program, you go through your first week by having the application on your mobile device and monitoring your sleep. It asks you a few questions about your day such as stress, overall tiredness and whether you used electronics or had a meal within three hours of trying to go to sleep. Each night you answer these same questions and the application collects all of the data throughout the week which is compiled at the end of the 7th day and then produces a comprehensive report about your sleep patterns. For me in particular, I have to try to eat my meals earlier in the night as well as shut down my electronics so that my mind has a chanced to unwind. The results will be different for everyone but the report that comes back is filled with information on how to improve your sleep by going to bed earlier, resetting your body clock to try to get up at a set time each day, even on weekends. By doing this, you are helping to get your mind and body ready for the day when you get up. Even if you don’t have a great night sleep, the program wants you to get up at the same time in order to get better sleep the following night. I think this system can really help someone get a better night’s sleep if they stick to doing the initial seven nights worth of tracking and then starting the next exercises that the app will start on night eight and going forward. I have sleep apnea and use a C-PaP and have had troubles sleeping for quite some time. With some minor changes, I am confident that using this and the various tips and tricks it is providing to me will help me improve so that I’m not so tired during my waking hours.",1
3,8,5-Jan-00,"My first impression of the SmartSleep system. I was curious to see if this would help me understand why my sleep patterns are so bad. I received the package and upon opening the box, I was underwhelmed to say the least. It was just an inexpensive spiral journal with a QR code. That's a pretty expensive iOs or Android app. Ok, so let's see what it has to offer. I download and install the app on my original Pixel phone and enter the needed information. I then see I can connect my Fitbit Charge 2 to it and so I do that. Really easy to do, just log in to my Fitbit app and the Philips app asks for permissions. Wow, so lets see if this will give me more information that the Fitbit app. Guess what...nope, I don't see any additional information about my sleep. The results are what I enter when I wake up. It asks a few questions upon waking and that's what your results are..nothing extra. The graph it shows is identical to the sleep results in the Fitbit app...ugh. I tried it for 3 nights before submitting this review just in case it needed the multiple results, but that didn't seem to do anything. The daily results page says to wait for the app to download the Fitbit results, but I'm still waiting for the first day, let alone all three days. There's a sync icon in the middle of a cloud that you would think you should tap to get it to sync, but again...it doesn't do anything. I'll update this review should it update or if by using it for a week gathers better sleep info. So as to how I feel about the app. It's doesn't add anything to the tools I use already, so why bother. The information is useful to someone that doesn't have another program already giving you results, but if you use a Fitbit with sleep info, this won't be of any further benefit, at least in my opinion. It works, but doesn't give me what I was hoping for. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as it doesn't come with any hardware and the hardware one would use usually comes with an existing app. Rather disappointing...again IMHO.",1
3,9,4-Jan-00,"First of all the box contains nothing but a small journal, a QR code to download the mobile app and a code for a one year subscription to the Smartsleep app. As for the app, it asks you several questions pre sleep and post sleep regarding your behavior which might impact your sleep and what you thought of your nights sleep. It asks you to track at least five days before it reports on your findings. Each night you open the app prior to sleep, answer a few questions and allow it to record sound. I used it 7 consective nights and it did a pretty good job tracking my sleep patterns. The report at the end of that period mainly consisted of items related to the feedback I provided in the app and duration of when I started and stop the sleep session. However it did record numerous snoring incidents which was both interesting and creepy. Unfortuanately I had a cold during the tracked sleep week, so snoring was probably more pronounced than usual, although still concerning. I have a mouthpiece I sometimes use at night, however being sick I did not have a chance to use it. It will be interesting seeing what another week of tracked sleep sessions reveal when I'm not sick and use the mouthpiece. As for the app it is slickly done and interfaces with several health monitoring devices like FitBits and various smart watches, I did not utilized this functionality. Overall this is a decent sleep tracking solution, however wish it came with some type of tracking hardware, seems a bit much for what you get. There are other free or nearly free mobile apps that perform the same analysis.",1

Did I take a nap? Did I have caffeine? After the 5 or 7 days the 'report' simply regurgitated this in a new form compiled from the days I entered it. The only thing this app did was record me sleeping...and snoring. I used the Philips Snore Relief Band with it in hopes of seeing a correlation between the amount of snoring and wearing of the band...nothing. My snoring was the same and my sleep quality and quantity was still horrible. The report also told me I need to sleep later in the morning. I get up at 4:15am for a reason...its called my job. And, it told me to go to bed later than I normally do. I am usually asleep by 8:30pm and this told me to change my bed time to 9:30. I have tried a few things to help me get better sleep and so far nothing has helped. The hardest thing about this is remembering to turn it on. The best part was when I had a nightmare and it recorded me growling in my sleep.",1
3,11,4-Jan-00,"I’ve already spent many hours researching sleep & ways to improve it, so I wasn’t expecting too much from the program. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised. While the program is designed to create better habits over the long run, my sleep is already improving. I’ll have to stay committed (like any workout program) if I expect to see big results. I’m also using the Philips SmartSleep Light Therapy Lamp. The lamp pairs well with this program. Once you download the Sleeprate App, it will guide you through an initial questionnaire. Then, over the next 7 days, it collects data about your sleep (based on your input) & provides an initial assessment. The more information you provide, the better the results. - It has the ability to record sound (very helpful, especially if you snore!) - It can collect data if you use a heart rate tracking device - It also has an alarm option Once you receive your initial Assessment Report, it will start you on a journey of weekly challenges. Each challenge comes with written information & short videos that explain the whys & benefits to the challenge. The App also has many other helpful short videos that cover the gamut, from the basics to the science of sleep. One of the greatest benefits of the program is the encouragement you’ll receive to create & maintain good habits that will improve your sleep. When you know you’ll be tracking your habits each day, it has a motivating effect on your behavior. I would recommend starting the program when you know you'll be able to commit to tracking your sleep on a consistent basis. It only takes a minute at bedtime & a couple of minutes when you wake, but consistency is the key. I would definitely recommend this program for anyone who is not 100% satisfied with their sleep.",0
3,12,2-Jan-00,"The Philips - SmartSleep Better Sleep Program 1-Year Subscription is a software/app driven experience designed to monitor and analyze sleep patterns to make recommendations to improve individual's sleep. I was surprised that there is really no tech involved unless you provide it. The box was huge compared to the instructions manual/journal and quarter-page QR code sheet where you download and subscribe to their app. Nothing else. It takes a minimum of 7 days to ""calibrate"" your sleep to the app just to get their recommendations. You will get a basic summary each morning but only recommendations and their ""plan"" after a full 7 days. I was using an Apple Watch for my tracker, which is a terrible partner to this product since most apple watches cannot last a full 24-hours on a charge. This meant I had to take off my watch before bed and charge it from the daily usage or risk it dying in the middle of the night. A Fitbit or some other type of tracker might work better if they have mulitple days per charge. I found this whole process to be cumbersome and frustrating. The final 7-day report was underwhelming at best. I have had similar results and findings from the Apple app and other free download apps. Nothing in the results really made the 7-days worth the hype and anticipation of ""reclaim you sleep, reclaim your life."" Go to bed at the same time and get up at the same time everyday is pretty common knowledge... I didn't need this app to tell me that. Who, in the modern day, has time to journal their sleep? Just seems out of touch with today! PROS - Interesting Concept - 1 yr subscription - App driven, requires smarthphone and a comparable wearable to be useful. CONS - Minimum of 7-days before you get any real results - App driven, requires smarthphone and a comparable wearable to be useful. - Not great companion with Apple Watch due to battery limitations. - Paper journal seems very outdated.",0
3,13,4-Jan-00,"I've worked hard to overcome a lifelong problem with sleep. I've managed to get to a point where I can fall asleep fairly easily, but if I wake up (when I wake up), it's very hard to fall back asleep. I picked up the SmartSleep Program to overcome that problem. The system came with a sleep diary (that includes suggestions, tips, and advice), and an app. The app has you complete a 7 night sleep assessment and a questionnaire. From what I can tell, you must complete the questionnaire before you finish the 7 night sleep assessment because the questionnaire locked for me once my 7th night had been logged (which is frustrating). Once the assessment is complete, the app notes challenges, offers suggestions, and even provides videos. You need to log your nightly sleep experience and it will keep statistics, showing trends and compare you with aggregate groups. I use an iPhone and have an Apple Watch. The SmartSleep app is installed on my iPhone. I tried once to link my watch with the app on my phone to get my nightly log automatically, but I wasn't able to figure it out (make of that what you will. I plan to try again once I'm further along on the plan). For those of us who suffer from sleeping challenges, this program isn't going to be a silver bullet that fixes everything in a night or two, but the system does give users a path towards that end. The System empowers users to be more mindful of their habits, and offers reminders and instructions in a timely way. It's going to take work, but, over time, I'm certain that my sleep will improve. I've given the system 4 stars. I took 1 star away because I wasn't able to finish the questionnaire once I logged my 1st 7 nights of sleep; and because I wasn't able to link my watch and the app on my phone (both were my fault, but the SmartSleep people could have made things easier and more obvious). I would recommend this to problem sleepers who are willing to give it a serious chance and work through at least a month. It gets easier, but it's a lot of work at the start.",0
3,14,4-Jan-00,"I am usually a healthy person but I have struggled with sleeping issues most of my life. Either because I have very sensitive ears - I wake up at the sound of anything, even a whisper -, or because I wake in the middle of the night and get back to sleep. In addition, I suffered from obstructive apnea although I have never been obese. It was never a loud snore but it did affect me badly. I fixed that over two years ago with a simple mouth guard, which improved my sleep and my life quality in a way I never thought I would experience. The reason I am saying that is that I truly believe that you not always need to spend thousands of dollars to improve your health. A simple solution might work better than very expensive ones. Maybe not for everyone but that worked for me really well. Although my sleep quality improved considerably, I still wake up in the middle of the night a few times a week and just cannot get back to sleep. I have used an app called SnoreLab and it tells me that I rarely snore. When it does happen, it lasts for less than 5 minutes a night. I also use iFit Sleep tracker under my mattress, which works really well. All that, tells me how good or bad my sleep pattern is. Therefore, the promise of a program that would help me keep asleep caught my attention. I tried this Philips SmartSleep program with the hope it would provide me with the tools to help me keep asleep or at least fall back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night. First, it came in a package that looked like there was something more than just a journal and a QR code. Nice but that was it. Second, I downloaded the Sleeprate app by scanning the QR code. Very easy and no issues When I used it for the first night, I was nicely surprised that it could use the iFit Sleep tracker. It also had the option to use my Apple watch but I opted for the former since I don’t have to wear it and I don’t have to worry about keeping it charged. I was expecting a lot from this program but I was quickly disappointed. In the first morning, it greeted me but there was no data available for me to see. It just submitted the data to Philips for analysis. The same happened in the next three nights. It was frustrating to wait that long to see the result on the app but I finally got it. It was detailed, including recording of sounds – I snored only twice for a few seconds in those days. It included everything my iFit and the SnoreLab apps have but that was it. Today, I opened the app and it told me there was an Assement Report. It was somewhat detailed but nothing new to me; except that I tend to overestimate the time it takes for me to fall asleep. Now, I will follow their “improvement” program and see if I will benefit from it. In summary, all the information I got was redundant although I like the fact that I have to use only one app to track my sleep now. I like the videos and instructions but again, it is something you can get free online if you have the patience. Personally, I would pay for an app that puts everything in one place like this Philips program does. Since it is coming from a big company with healthcare experience, I really wish they had included some physical monitoring tool or something to justify its purchase. I simply ignored the included journal, which looks more like something for a kid. Overall, the program is not bad but I was expecting more than what I’ve got. Even if following the program will help me in the long run, Philips should have worked in its presentation better. So far, I am not impressed.",1
3,15,4-Jan-00,"The presentation of this product is impressive, but what really impresses is inside the box, there is only one diary and a QR code to activate the one-year subscription. The application needs to evaluate you for a week, later it will be based on what it learned during that period, to be able to help you. The app with the journal will guide you through information and challenges, in order to be more aware of the importance of sleeping well. The information is really valuable and if you have discipline, since it is important to keep the information in the newspaper and the application up to date, it may be a great help for you. I think that if Philips added some device or something that could track the dream in real time, the results could be much better. In summary, do not expect much, despite of the stunning presentation of the product, you will only have a personalized guide on your cell phone and a journal that will have to be filled out as you go. If you have a compatible smartwatch, it may be helpful.",0
3,16,3-Jan-00,"I have mixed feelings about this program. I am reviewing this using an iPhone with an Apple watch series 3. I got the app because I have problems getting quality sleep at night, particularly deep sleep. I can wake up often but fall back asleep quickly. I think my quality of sleep could be improved, especially when compared to other friends who similarly track their sleep. This seemed like a good step to take. The good: The app offers some good training and information on steps for better sleep. It provides questionnaires for you to answer to collect information on your habits and how you think you slept. It identifies your sleep efficiency, your bedtime, wake-up time, how long it took you to fall asleep, and how much time you spent waking up throughout the night. They provide you a notebook/journal to track personal notes as well as spaces in the app to store the information. The Bad: While this app offers some good features, it feels too much of a manual process. Ideally, you need to “Prepare for bed” on the app each night. Then answer the same questions you answer every day. Same in the morning. I use other apps that will automatically track when you go to bed. This will automatically track your sleep as well to some extent, but I question some of its accuracy. It tells me I fall asleep within 1 minute almost each night. I know for a fact this isn’t true, I don’t know many people that fall asleep that quickly. Another issue I noticed is that this would wrongly affect the numbers on my other sleep app and even activity on my Apple watch some times. It didn’t happen all the time, but some days I would wake up with my activity bars closed 3 times over already for that day and about 1/5 of my sleep in my sleep app. Overall: The app also offer challenges, but I only attempted to do a couple. One of them was to stop taking naps during the week. However, it requires some real dedication to stick to the program. This may be good for someone with a routine schedule that doesn’t change much. People who don’t have much of dynamic schedule and who really want to improve their sleep. For other people such as myself who go out on weekends and sometimes during the week, and has an unpredictable schedule, its quite difficult to remember to start the sleep process through the app, answer questions before bed and when you wake up, especially when I’m absolutely not a morning person. If you’re serious about it, then I’d recommend the app but if you’re just curious or have a non-standard schedule it may not be the best for you.",1
3,17,2-Jan-00,"I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review. The Phillips Smart Sleep program is a well designed system to analyze and help improve your sleep. The packaging is a little overkill with a large box containing a small book! The book is a journal that you are supposed to keep notes. The first half walks you through several questions about your sleep, the second half is a journal to keep notes about your sleep. I read it but kept no notes. The program takes place mostly on the Sleeprate app you load on your smartphone. You answer a few questions about your sleep then you start your initial 1 week analysis to identify any sleep challenges after that the program offers you an analysis and you can choose your goals. You can use a sleep tracker like a smartwatch several of which are compatible with the app. The app will offer you challenges weekly based on your analysis there are no set tracks so it is totally personalized. I personally had good sleep so my challenge was to change the sleep period by going to bed earlier and waking up earlier the program monitored my sleep and slowly helped modify this. I found this tool helped me achieve this goal that I could not on my own. If you are really into harnessing your sleep you may consider the Smartsleep deep sleep headband this is the next step in the program. It is a true sleep monitor to enhance your non rem deep sleep that can give you more energy and improve your performance. I plan to invest in one of these in the near future.",1
3,18,4-Jan-00,The best part of this system is there is no additional hardware to deal with other than the app. Installing and setting up the app is very easy. The system is even better if you have a wearable device that can track heart rate when you sleep. I have been using this for about a week and it has provided valuable information about my sleep.,0
3,19,4-Jan-00,"This is a nice sleep program if you are self motivated. Sleep hygiene is one of the most important things to restful sleep. Pros: Easy installation. Once you open the box there is a QR code that brings you to the app store. You download the app and it automatically activates your membership. Follow the instructions to get to the home page. Pre questionnaires: These are quick and easy to complete. They focus on many aspects of sleep. Detailed assessment report: In order to access this you must track your sleep for 7 nights. Once you finish the 7th night it provides a detailed report. This report contains a summary of your questionnaire surveys, bedtime and wake-up times, sleep structure, sleep efficiency, sleep satisfaction, habits, and more. Based on this information it designs weekly challenges to slowly change poor sleep hygiene habits. Videos: There are short informational videos you can watch that cover a broad range of topics such as screen time, caffeine use, science of sleep, etc. Integrated alarm: It is convenient to be able to set an alarm within the app. Cons: Large box with a small journal. This could be integrated into the app. I am much more likely to make a journal entry if it was integrated. Overall: This is a great product if you are willing to put in the time and effort. It will not improve your sleep immediately but instead change your habits over time to promote restful sleep. If you have trouble sleeping give it a try. I plan to stick with it and see if I can improve my sleep while changing some of my bad habits.",1
3,20,4-Jan-00,"The premise behind this sleep app is to help individuals regain mental clarity, be more conscious of healthier living and increase daily energy by assessing and improving sleep habits that lead to sounder sleep. The subscription last for one year and the program works in three stages, all of which can be revisited throughout the duration of the subscription. The assessment app can be downloaded through the app store or by using the QR card that comes with the program. The QR card acts as your subscription key as well. The sleep app targets three areas: 1. Assesses your sleep, 2. Helps you retrain your sleep habits by presenting you with a personalized program toward change, and 3. Leads you to take measures that provide better sleep habits and results for more rested sleep. The Sleep assessment works with many types of wearable products. I prefer to charge my iWatch at night, so I usually sleep with my Fitbit Charge3 which works great with this app and program. The Sleeprate App is no different than any other tracker. It doesn’t automatically change your sleep habits, but it probably does work on your subconscious mind to some degree. For one to benefit from its full impact, personal dedication to change bad habits and regain sounder sleep must be a commitment just like any other habit you wish to change. To begin the process, there is a short assessment survey that needs to be answered, and then there are 5-6 short questions that need to be answered each evening when you are ready to sleep. The app also provides short videos on various topics that one may not have even thought about that can influence sound sleep. I found these to be short and to the point and all applicable to my personal bad sleep habits. For a week the app records sound, etc. in your sleep environment, and when it syncs to (in my case a Fitbit) a sleep tracker, it shows how many hours of sleep were sound sleep, deep sleep, rem sleep, or hours/minutes that were spent awake during the night. By being able to record the sounds in the room, the app was also able to record the times during the night that I snored, talked, etc. After a week, the app provided me with a sleep assessment that pointed out bad sleep habits and presented a personalized guide toward developing habits that would improve sleep patterns and my overall well-being. One of the issues that I had with the app was that my information for my 1st week was lost when my app was set to sleep the night immediately following the first assessment. I could not seem to find anywhere on the app where this information could be regained for future reference, or to read it again in depth when I was more alert. I am now in week 2 and will be more diligent about studying the assessment before it is lost. I will continue to use the app and do feel that it will help me restore myself to better sleep habits. I hardly ever dream, or I never remember dreaming, so I am looking forward to possibly dreaming pleasant dreams again. Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",0
3,21,5-Jan-00,"Admittedly, this review is kind of shallow as the real ""results"" can't be measured until the multi-week course is complete. But, so far, this looks great. My wife has always had trouble falling/staying asleep while still feeling sluggish throughout the day. This is NOT a miracle bullet for that. This is a sort of a workout regimen for sleep helping to establish new habits/patterns for better. Just like working out, it needs commitment to measure and establish your road map. The interface is easy to use, and once her Fitbit was connected, it really laid out the truth about her patterns. I'm with her on this journey, but with what we've done so far, it has been helpful in guiding her in the right direction. So, the rating is based on the limited use, the great interface, and the exercise usefulness thus far. Happy sleeping.",0
3,22,5-Jan-00,"I'm really still undecided on the Philips Sleepsmart. It's coming up to a week and I have been following the program and guides while some nights I have slept better, others I have woken up exhausted. I really need about a month to make a final decision (wish I could edit this review in a month) but want to share initial thoughts... Despite the huge box, what you're really buying is a sleep diary and a code to unlock a 1 year app subscription. The app is a sleep coach and it does make you think more actively about your sleep quality, what may be causing problems, and helps you change your behavior. If you want it to work then it also takes discipline on your side. After all, it can only guide you, you have to change! What I MUST point out though is you have some other wearable like an Apple Watch, Fibit or similar you can connect the app to that to provide more integrated readings. So it does take advantage of any smart hardware you do have. I found this useful as the Philips SmartSleep system does provide more meaningful detail than Apple's Health kit. But the thing is to get the REAL value if you start discovering or what to treat other sleep-related issues you need you need to start buying extra physical hardware sold by Philips. For example, I snore (apologies to my partner) and while the app can kind-of help you really need to start paying for the snore monitor that makes you change position at night (an external thing you wear if you want to go to the next level). The app DOES record your snoring.... kind of embarassing... . This is where I think the kit would make more sense if it came bundled with something so I would get the ""Smartsleep Snore Kit"" If you're not sure if this is for you, I'd recommend downloading the app first as it has a free 7 day trial. Then work out if you need a 1 year subscription and if you do, then buy this. Just keep in mind you're buying a box with an app subscription and not any hardware. If you know what your issue is (like me, snoring) then you may be better paying more money straight away and buying the Philips Snoring Relief band that is sold by Best Buy. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/philips-smartsleep-snoring-relief-band-gray/6359515.p?skuId=6359515 and a final reminder again, if you get this you're buying an app subscription and nothing else. Don't be fooled by the size of the box... IMPORTANT TIP! the app subscription code is printed inside on the box (bottom right corner) so take care when opening the box and I'd recommend taking a photo if it as soon as you open the box. Once you register the subscription is connected to your account, but if you're like my home my partner is always keen to throw out boxes as soon as things are unpacked and you could find yourself losing your code before you get a chance to install the app!",0
3,23,4-Jan-00,"Before I get into talking about this program, I wanted to state that I already have a couple other Philips SmartSleep products, which I have used with both positive and neutral results. I’m wholeheartedly a fan of this line of Philips better sleep products, and eagerly await whatever other devices they may release to assist people who want, and need, to get a better night’s sleep. I’d like to say that I found this Philips SmartSleep Better Sleep Program with 1-year SleepRate Subscription beneficial, and that it helped me to modify habits I may have developed over time, which have prevented me from getting the restful sleep I need, in order to function during the day, and it has, but not to the extent that I had hoped for. Wanting to get the most out of this program, I took the time to read through the sleep journal, to familiarize myself with what all was in there. In addition, I spent some time going over the app’s features, completing the required questionnaires after inputting my personal information to better customize the program, just for me. So far so good. But a little more about the sleep journal. I found the text repetitive. It’s like, “Okay, I get the idea.” I’m sure the repetition of the same information and catch phrases, is meant to be encouraging, to reinforce what you can expect as you go through the program, but it just came across to me as though they were trying to pad the journal to give the impression that there was more content there than there actually was. Think of the sleep journal as a tool to use along with the SleepRate app, which consists of a program designed to motivate and help you develop techniques to “correct” (or retrain) your sleep habits so as to ‘fix’ specific sleep problems you may have. During the first week, you will fill in the questionnaires, track your sleep, and use the sleep journal every night. Once completed, you get your sleep assessment report and a personalized challenge via the app. There are also ‘Watch & Learn’ videos within the app to help teach you more about the health benefits of sleeping better. You are also able to connect a sleep tracking device, such as Apple Watch or Fitbit, to work in conjunction with the SleepRate app. It was great being able to view my sleep info in the app, and get a daily sleep assessment after answering a few questions regarding my previous night’s sleep experience. I consider this really helpful as a means to document my daily sleep data and to see patterns in my sleep routine. It was good to be able to track my heart rate during the night, as I have a heart-related issue and so that is a concern to me. There is even a ‘Dream Diary’ box to write in your dreams upon waking, before you forget them. But I will say, the ‘Sound Recordings’ of ambient noises in the room, was most enlightening. I kinda “knew” I snored, but this confirmed it. I’ve never heard myself snore before, hadn’t ever been recorded, yet there was the proof. Unless ... I can blame it on the dog. It will remain to be seen, as times goes on, as I continue with the program and complete the sleep challenges, how helpful this program will prove to be for me and my particular sleep issues. Although supposedly geared for me, based on what I inputted into the app, as I went through the daily assessments, it just felt really generic, and not personal to me at all. *Note: The SleepRate app glitched on me the second night, and my info wasn’t saved, so I had to manually input it, but that glitched too. On the third night, the app worked again, as intended. The SleepRate app needs improvement, or perhaps a software update. I will continue to use it, just be aware that this can happen. Now, I am sure this Philips SmartSleep Better Sleep Program with 1-year SleepRate Subscription will be a beneficial resource for sleep improvement for some, but it just didn’t fulfill my needs. Another thing, I really do consider this program, the sleep journal and app subscription’s cost, to be very much overpriced. I could see this being sold at something more fair, say like 50% off the list price.",0
3,24,3-Jan-00,"After using this program for the last month, it has helped me get into a better sleep routine. Something about having the book to go along with the app to write down my experiences instead of typing them into my phone has made me more aware of my tendencies.

I believe the ""auto"" pressure feature is an improvement but I really don't notice it while I'm sleeping. The machine will let you know what the pressure setting is at any given time. It should be noted the CPAP's blower comes on when I inhale, and stops when I exhale. This causes a small ""pulsing"" sound that took a night to get used too because my previous CPAP blower was on continuously. I do not like the ""ramp"" feature which starts at a lower pressure so that it feels you have to ""suck-in"" the air; but you can easily shut that feature off.",2
17,2,24-Oct-19,Cpap.com was really quick shipping and great customer service. The machine though is too noisy for me.

17,10,21-Mar-20,"I replaced a heavily used, dying ten year old CPAP with the Phillips DreamStation Auto-CPAP. I ended up buying the machine with my FSA because my insurance company wouldn't pay for a new one unless I underwent another sleep study. It was cheaper to pay the ENT for a new Rx and buy the machine out of pocket than the coinsurance would have run for another sleep study. Given my resistance to another sleep study, my ENT suggested an Auto-CPAP. I read the reviews of the various makes and models. The DreamStation AutoCPAP with the heated humidifier seemed to hit the sweet spot intersection of quality, performance, and price. Given that I had been using a ResMed CPAP designed and built in the early 2000s, what I noticed first was how much lighter in weight it was. On the first night of using it, my wife remarked how much quieter it was than the old one. Those are the two biggest plusses I've noticed. I used the same type of mask (full face, medium size) I am climbing the learning curve on using the diagnostic tools and app that came with it. Also, I am still clear on the benefits of the app. I could see showing the data to my ENT, but what am I going to do with it? I had some difficulties setting up the blue tooth. The user guide and manual are not very well written, IMO. I thought I would have some issues with the auto part of the CPAP learning my sleep habits. It figured me out before I got it figured out.

17,22,20-Feb-20,"A great, very quiet, easy to use product that with a low humidity setting only needs to be filled with water every 3 days (2). The only piece I have not understood is the screen light. It is supposed to respond to the amount of light in the room but after a few minutes of use it goes dark and stays dark until I turn it off and then the screen lights up and provides me data.",0
17,23,14-Feb-20,"They all say they are quiet and easy to use, but this machine is the quietest I have used, and the easiest to find the on/off button :) I have not used the humidifier. Incidentally, the TUBE SIZE often makes a huge difference in how quiet a CPAP is. I used the normal, larger tube with this machine rather than the smaller one that came with the machine. My only complaint would be that the tube connects to the back of the machine if you're not using the humidifier. That shortens your effective tube length. I did get a $6 elbow adapter to lessen the 180 degree curve from the back of the machine.",0

17,25,11-Feb-20,"I purchased this machine as a replacement for a Phillips Respironics System 60 machine which had begun to show its age , and it is truly as noiseless as claimed. There are some other differences, though. The machine came with only a user manual whereas all previous machines that I bought from CPAP.com came with a provider's manual as well. Also, the ramp mode seems to work automatically only on the first start in a 24-hour (noon-to-noon) period; all later starts begin with high pressure and one has to manually start the ramp mode. This is irritating when I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, or, as often happens to me, I turn on the machine inadvertently when putting in the water tank in the evening (the Start button is very sensitive). This must be a setting that can be changed, but in the absence of a provider manual, I suppose I must live with the issue.",0

17,27,13-Feb-20,"I like the CPAP functionality, but not the software. First, the bluetooth link does not work, so I cannot connect to DreamMapper as I did with the older Philips Respironics System One. Second, the DreamStation does not provide AHI information or the 90% pressure value as my old PR machine did. All it displays is therapy hours.",0

17,36,1-Feb-20,"Overall, I'm very pleased with the DreamStation and would recommend it. It is very quiet compared to my old CPAP, and real easy to use. I believe the ""auto"" pressure feature is an improvement but I really don't notice it while I'm sleeping. The machine will let you know what the pressure setting is at any given time. It should be noted the CPAP's blower comes on when I inhale, and stops when I exhale. This causes a small ""pulsing"" sound that took a night to get used too because my previous CPAP blower was on continuously. I do not like the ""ramp"" feature which starts at a lower pressure so that it feels you have to ""suck-in"" the air; but you can easily shut that feature off.",2

17,48,7-Dec-19,"After 10 years with my original CPAP machine I finally decided to retire it and upgrade to an automatic CPAP. It took a night or two to set my starting pressure correctly (lower than my prescribed pressure, but not too low), but after that it's been very comfortable to use and the Bluetooth APP charts the improvement in my sleep. I knew from using my portable APAP on vacations that my original prescribed pressure was lower than what the APAP would typically deliver so I expected a new APAP machine to give me a better experience and so far it has. I haven't used the humidifier yet because I generally like it cold when I sleep. Once the air gets very dry I may start using it.",1
17,49,1-Dec-19,just changed from a CPAP to an APAP and am blown away how much more comfortable it is to sleep. I’m waking up refreshed again. It feels like natural breathing and the noise is very minimal. Highly recommended!,2

17,58,24-Oct-19,Cpap.com was really quick shipping and great customer service. The machine though is too noisy for me. This is the auto adjusting CPAP machine and when it adjust the air flow it's noisy. It's like a loud humming noise which fluctuates with each inhale/exhale. Very annoying! Here is a link if you would like to hear the sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JdbbjlNJfs You can hear the wheezing sound with each breath. Not a fan of this machine.,9

17,60,22-Oct-19,The Dream Station is a upgrade for me. I used my old machine for years. I love the rich features and it's easy to use.

I covered the front with a cloth and now it's all good.,0
17,61,17-Oct-19,"This is my first new machine in ten years, and I'm delighted with the improvements. This machine is so quiet, only the user knows it's running.

The device was easy to install, and it comes with a heating chamber. I slept like a baby with this new machine. It so quiet that my wife didn't even notice that it was on, and I was using it.

Went looking for a machine that would take a lot of the fussing with things that I had heard about from friends and family members that have been in the club for a while: This machine takes most, if not all of the fussing out of getting ready to sleep, which is what we are all looking for a good and restful sleep. I'm glad I purchased this machine! Quiet, easy menus, easy access to humidifier tank a nice clean machine.",1
17,70,14-Sep-19,I absolutely love the Dreamstation CPAP! It runs quietly and I like the humidifier water chamber a lot. I don’t spill the water putting it in like I used too in my old machine.

I have to check to see if it is actually running, it is so quiet. I did not think I would need or like the humidifier, so far I have tried it both with and without, definitely humidifier is the way to go. I love the fact that I can remove the humidifier chamber if I need to for travels. Plus, I do not need a special side panel if I need to remove humidifier chamber. It is sleek, flat design not having to worry it is going to topple, slip over off my night stand. Do I recommend this product, absolutely!!",0

17,79,11-Feb-20,"I bought this to replace an ICON machine I'd had for about 4 years, figuring it would be a ""step up"". It's not - no clock display, no way to adjust the humidification (if you get the heated hose), one night the humidifier runs dry, the next night it hardly uses any water, the pressure varies tremendously (I thought an APAP was supposed to adjust to your needs?), a host of other issues - I'll summarize that all-in-all, if I knew then what I know now, I would not have purchased it.",3
18,1,24-Mar-20,"I have had this machine for over 1 month and have traveled with it several times (air and train). Also purchased the humidifier option with the travel case. This is a great machine for travel as it easily fits in a backpack and the fact that it does not have any protruding knobs I do not worry about it getting damaged. The screen an menu system are easy to see and use. I am a bit disappointed is the sound level. A bit louder then I was expecting for a newer machine. I am using the smaller dia hose and was going to try the larger hose to see if this makes a difference. Not having the larger buttons is nice for travel, however with the touch button and screen I struggle to turn my machine off at night when I get up. You get use to it so it is not too bad. If it was quieter I would give it 5 stars - quality machine!!",0
18,2,6-Mar-20,"It is a lot noisier than I'm used to. Don't know if it is the smaller diameter hose or not. But, I will use it when I travel!!",0
18,3,2-Mar-20,I am a new CPAP user. I looked at many types of units and read the reviews. I like that this unit has an integrated power supply - not black box on the power cord. The humidifier and battery (when needed) connect easily to make a single unit. The machine is quiet and easy to use.,0
18,4,24-Feb-20,I just received this machine so I haven't used it.,0
18,5,21-Feb-20,Bought this due to travel for work has increased. I went on my first trip this week and it works great easy to pack and setup. I can carry it in my computer back pack so no worries about leaving it in the room.,0
18,6,20-Feb-20,"Having used a cpap for the last 14 years I am thrilled to find a travel machine that is so compact and light. I do not use a humidifier when I travel so that cut the weight of my old travel mate REMstarPlus, but it was still heavy. I use a swift head gear with nasal pillows and do not notice any noise. I really like the auto start, ramp and flex and that the air flow adjusts to my need. Super pleased with this purchase.",0
18,7,5-Feb-20,Bought this because I was tired lugging around my CPAP machine with the power supply that weighs as much as a shot put. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Can use my regular mask. I can keep track of use of both devices with the smartphone app. Wish I had made the purchase earlier.,0
18,8,4-Feb-20,"I made my first trip last weekend. The unit is small, but the real savings when packing is the hose. The hose is narrower and very flexible. So far, I am also using this machine at home. Quiet! Small footprint!",0
18,9,3-Feb-20,"Not heavy and really good for travel, even it work really great at home too.",0
18,10,17-Jan-20,Love this cpap. Works great and quiet. Bought a case for it. The tubing is also very light weight. No more lugging around my larger cpap machine.,0
18,11,15-Jan-20,"After growing tired of lugging my full sized CPAP on long trips, I finally bought this portable. It is great! First, and most important, it works great. It’s quiet and delivers the same benefit as my full sized machine. As to size, it fits nicely in my carry on bag. I still needed space for the hose and mask, but all together they leave me with a lot of room for other stuff in my carryon. I bought the case and longer cord and am glad I did. The case is small, holding the machine and narrower hose and offers needed protection for the device. The longer cord makes it possible to reach outlets in some hotel rooms. Also, the cord plugs directly into the machine with that bulky power adapter, saving even more room. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this truly portable CPAP machine.",0
18,12,12-Jan-20,"I am very pleased with my new Dream Station Go. I give this product a 10. I read all the reviews on other travel products and was getting frustrated because some one Always had something negative to say. This product had fewer negative reviews and I now know why, it’s perfect. It’s very quiet. My wife couldn’t believe how quiet it is. The App is very informative. I wasn’t sure about the Auto setting. After using it it is amazing how it auto adjusts.",0
18,13,10-Jan-20,"I am so glad I got this CPAP. However, the rubber cover on the side was broken off when I got it.",0
18,14,31-Dec-19,"While visiting rels in Cali, my older travel apap went paws up. I checked the reviews for travel apaps on cpap.com and decided on the Dreamstation Go, and cpap.com overnighted the machine to me. I observed that there is something about the pressure regulating algorithm for the DS Go that seems to work especially well for me. My AHI was immediately less than half of what I have been getting, this has not changed over 8 days, and far fewer leaks (all with identical settings and same mask.) It's also quite light, compact, and easy to set up and use. I liked it so much that I just ordered the larger model of the Dream Station to replace my Airsense 10 for at home use. (Hope I get the same results as with the ""Go"".) The DS Go gets a 5 star rating, and this from someone who almost never submits a review for anything. .",0
18,15,11-Dec-19,I also have the Dreamstation. This works just as good. It's easier to pack and travel with.,0
18,16,8-Dec-19,LOVE this cpap machine!! So quiet I can hardly hear it. The air pressure was perfect for me with no air leaking out around the face. We are getting ready to travel to Costa Rica so I ordered this. I tried it out for about 4 nights and fell in love with it. I actually prefer it to my home cpap machine. I was so skeptical...needlessly!,0
18,17,28-Nov-19,"Machine works as advertised. To this point, I have only used it for one night and had no issues with it. It is a bit noisier than my ResMed AirSense 10 but that is of no concern for me since my previous machine, an old Resperonics Remstar LX, was much noisier than the Dreamstation Go. I bought this machine for travel purposes as I really don't want to carry around a rental machine from my provider (AirSense 10) to my camping trips and other, away from home activities, that involve overnight stays. This one appealed to me the most out of all the portable units due to the more universal nature of the unit (standard ac cord, use any mask you want without mods). It also really appealed to me that it had a display on the unit itself and that it had an option for a humidifier. The only drawback I am encountering now, and I wish I had done a bit more research on, is using this thing off the grid. There is no direct to DC option for this unit as of yet. Don't know if there ever will be or if it is even possible. I know there is a battery option for it but I am off the grid at times for a good 5 to 7 days at a time and that battery would not even make it through two, 7 hour sleep nights for me and I don't want to have to continually recharge the battery every day. I have looked into other options, shuch as a good sized portable power station but I am afraid that I would only get a day or two of use out of those as well becuase this device only uses AC. If there was a direct to DC option, like many of the other CPAP machines (portable or standard), then one of those portable power stations might last the time that I require. Due to this fact, I had to deduct at least the one star off of the unit. Other than that, it is a five star unit as it does what it is supposed to do.",1
18,18,22-Nov-19,"Only used the product 1 night to test it out as its a back up travel machine. I had no problems with it at all and since I dont use humidifier, its nice and small.",0
18,19,19-Nov-19,Easily to travel with and like to that it has a battery pack and a humidifier option.,0
18,20,15-Nov-19,I purchased this to replace an S9. It is very good. It is small and very quiet. The only issue I have is that it is difficult to get the button/touch screen to turn off the unit.,0
18,21,14-Nov-19,"After wasting money on a much cheaper travel CPAP from a different manufacturer I decided to spring for a Dreamstation Go. I wanted it for use on board an airplane while traveling and was concerned that the inherently dry air would be an issue so I added the humidifier. The machine is way quieter than my PR series 60, the lack of a transformer/power brick a pleasure and I'm so happy with it that I have not bothered to set up my series 60 machine in my vacation home (from where I'm writing this review). I used it en route on a ten hour flight and it gave me the best sleep I've ever had on an airliner. I love the readout of therapy numbers and the auto on feature is excellent especially considering that the ""spot"" on the machine that represents the power button has no tactile feedback and it would require visually locating it on the top panel to turn the machine on. The auto off function only works if the headgear or hose is disconnected from the machine. I'd like to know why but that's a really minor issue. I recommend this machine highly. Given the size, performance and feature set it is a great piece of equipment.",1
18,22,8-Nov-19,Love the DreamStation Go fo travel; so light an so compact and I can use my accustomed mask,0
18,23,5-Nov-19,"set up was easy, small compact to fit in my suitcase for all my business travel. I'm sleeping very comfortably on my work travels.",0
18,24,24-Oct-19,The Phillips DreamStation Go is the perfect complement to my Philips DreamStation when I am called out of town or out of the country. It’s small and compact size and quality construction is outstanding! It fits easily in an overnight bag or backpack. Great for those truly on the “Go.” Very satisfied and highly recommend!,0
18,25,22-Oct-19,"Works very well both on “AC” and on its battery pack. Really impressed with the auto on when the mask is placed on the face. We got two of them, one for my wife and one for myself to make traveling easier, and they really have. I would recommend this travel C-PAP to anyone who travels a lot or needs a backup that has a custom battery backup as an option.",0
18,26,12-Oct-19,"This relatively compact travel machine works very well, perhaps better than my full-sized Dreamstation.",0
18,27,10-Oct-19,"I travel for a living and I don’t need a humidifier. That means this is the perfect CPAP for me. I find it to be light, easy to figure out and very user-friendly. Highly recommend.",0
18,28,10-Oct-19,LOVE my new cpap machine. Tiny in comparison to my old one. Auto start is amazing. The only thing I would change is to make the power button (on top) have some kind of tactile item on or around it to make it easier to find.,0
18,29,25-Sep-19,"Small & compact machine that works well. Info downloads to your iphone, so no need for a chip, etc. I'm very satisfied.",1
18,30,16-Sep-19,"This is a good travel choice because, while not quite as small as some, it is is simple to carry. No ""brick"" in the cord, no extra adapters or other fiddly bits. If you don't carry the humidifier the unit and battery travel as a single unit. One minor nag is that the start button is a flush mounted touch button lacking any haptic feedback - you can't just reach over in the dark and feel it to use it.",1
18,31,11-Sep-19,"I bought this for everyday and travel. I like the sleek design and the lack of a power brick is a big plus. I also wanted to see how the algorithm for this machine compared to my Resmed S9 Escape. There are times the S9 was too aggressive in changing the pressure and it would wake me up. I did fiddle around with some of the settings and it helped, but I also felt it was time for a change. The DreamStation Go is gentler when increasing the pressure and perhaps, because I was used to the aggressive rise in pressure, I thought it was not increasing the pressure enough. A little fiddling with the settings should fix this. The mini tube is great! Small, flexible and doesn't bind on your mask when sleeping. Overall all, I am please with the unit and look forward to taking it on trips. Especially, now that I can slip it into my carry on bag. Cons: - It is slightly noisier than my S9, but a set of ear plugs resolves the problem and I can sleep. - The hose location is opposite of the power cord. Depending on how you have it set up, it takes more room on my nightstand. The S9 had the hose and cord connected to the back so it was a cleaner and less jumbled look. I could let the cord and hose dangle behind the nightstand. - I wish the power button was raised so it was easier to find by touch. I will probably put a sticker or something that does not interfere with the swipe detection.",1
18,32,31-Aug-19,I am on the road a lot for business travel and this travel size provides me with the CPAP treatment I need in a compact convenient size without compromising functionality and not needing to have an extra bag to carry. Love it!,0
18,33,27-Aug-19,"Dream Station Go took some effort but got it to work as described. Was mostly interested in use with the optional battery. Used at an elevation of 7500 feet and results were not as expected. Battery consumption was significantly more than outlined in website and in manual. Started at 100% and after seven hours of use had only 18% available. Second night results were similar. Used battery at home (200 feet elevation) to compare. Results were much different with 43% remaining after seven hours of use. Otherwise overall performance is as described on website. Plan to use primarily when traveling and with battery ONLY when charging is KNOWN to be available. So, be careful where you use it!",1

Was easy to set up using manuals, displays info more easily /nicer than old machine. I was very hesitant to buy something so expensive on the internet, but the website is well designed (which made me choose THIS seller) and made my comparison shopping easy. Very happy w machine AND seller.",0

Also, Phillip’s is offering a $100 rebate until 3/31/19. You can also use the same tubing between each device!",1
18,46,20-Jan-19,"I like this machine. It's a nice size. It's easy to set up. The hose is light-weight and comfy; it doesn't make a lot of noise when it rubs across the nightstand or bed. With my full-size CPAP, I use a heated hose, so it took a little getting used to the cool air. I do wish it had a humidifier, as I awake with a very dry throat.",1
18,47,8-Dec-18,"I bought this machine after using my home Dreamstation machine without the humidifier on a business trip. The noise level of the home machine without the humidifier was unbearable so I began looking at the travel version. I am glad I did! The dreamstation go does what my home system does but on a much smaller and quieter scale. The quality of sleep is the same. The ability to travel easily with the dreamstation go is so much easier. TSA barely gives it a second glance. It is SLIGHTLY more noisy through the mask than my home machine with the humidifier but infinitely quieter than it is without the humidifier. The lack of humidification was a concern at first, but since using the dreamstation go, I haven’t noticed a big difference. Awesome machine that is worth the money. Cpap.com has been a great resource and supplier over the last 7 years of my cpap use. Would highly recommend cpap.com and the dreamstation go machine.",4
18,48,4-Dec-18,"I travel frequently and wanted an easy to pack device. The CpapGoAuto is perfect. I didn’t realize how much better I would sleep and feel using an Auto Cpap. Highly recommended. Also, the lightweight mini tube is so much better than the old heavy tube. Noticible difference.",1
18,49,17-Oct-18,"I use a CPAP, but I abhor carrying my heavy, unwieldy device through the TSA line and onboard a plane. To that end, I finally decided to spring for the DreamStation Go.

18,54,4-Oct-18,"I purchased the DreamStation as I travel frequently internationally. I read all the reviews and did research on different travel machines. This one seemed the best fit for me as I could use my current mask with it. I am NOT disappointed. It is a great machine! I've used it in Canada and in Italy for 12 days with zero issues. It doesn't need a power converter, only a country plug. I thought I'd miss the humidifier, but it wasn't too bad and I didn't feel much difference. It is so lightweight and easy to travel with and pack into another bag for discretion. I was not asked to remove it at security in Italy, Germany or Canada. The noise is slightly more than my at home machine, but not disturbing to me at all. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who travels frequently. I would suggest buying the case with it as well. I had to makeshift a case out of a cosmetic bag, which works but is not as protective as I'd like.",7

I received it in perfect condition ready to go.,0

If you pack the unit in your carryon bag, be prepared to take it out for security and to explain what it is. And not just to the inspectors -- I never knew there were so many CPAP users until they all wanted to see my machine.",0
18,60,3-Oct-18,"The integrated battery option is easy to travel with. I have used it when the outlets are far from the bed as well as sleeping without electricity. The larger case with the battery is easy to pack in a backpack or small carryon. Using the machine was pretty simple and I downloaded the manual to change the settings to match my doctor’s prescription. My only problem with the machine is the noise on inhale. I’m a light sleeper and this is much louder than my regular machine, comparable to darth Vader. The noise wasn’t bad initially but it’s gotten much worse over time. I tried the white noise app on my phone but it was no match. I would say it’s a waste of money if you’re a light sleeper, because I usually end up giving up after a few hours and sleeping without the machine. I was worried the lack of humidity would be a problem for me, but it’s been fine except for a few nights I used it in a literal desert, and even then drinking hot tea before bed eliminated a sore throat",11
18,61,3-Oct-18,"The size is nice and the machine fits in my purse when traveling and going through security at airports. It seems to be made well. The problem is that it is very loud. It keeps me up at night. My family can hear the machine, as well.",3

18,66,23-Jun-18,"The Dreamstation is smaller than my normal machine, significantly lighter, and the hose is quite smaller as well. Nonetheless I can use my normal mask with it. This combination makes for an excellent travel Cpap. I can finally pack my Cpap in my suitcase and not have to carry it in it’s own carry bag. This is huge for me. Plus I don’t have to break down my daily use machine every time I trave. The Dreamstation is very quiet and functions great. I used it overnight and noticed no difference in function at all, and I’m pretty sensitive to that. I highly recommend it for travel.",3

I love this devices tracking features and the ability to simply put on the mask and have the cpap turn on automatically. It is a great device and good for home and travel. It does not have a humidifier option, but I do not use the humidifier so it made no difference to me.",2

24,2,2-Jun-19,"This headgear is great and inobtrusive. However it can slide off easily while you sleep, and I find the antimicrobial surface is both a bit irritating to my scalp (gives me foliculitis via rubbing/chafing).
I cut a wide hair band to length and stitched it around it. Works great that way (see included picture).
Also, minus one star because this strap just doesn't have any longevity. It seems to get ruined whether you hand wash it or toss it in the washer. The fabric tends to pill up, the strap gets too easily stretched out and loses its elasticity, and in general I probably have to replace it every three months.
Still giving it four stars, in part because the Dreamwear nasal headgear in general is the most comfortable mask I've ever used, and just can't use other more large and intrusive ones now. Also because... well, as noted I like the Dreamwear masks, and what can you do? There's no other viable headgear strap for it that I know of.",8
24,3,30-May-19,"I get these by prescription from a local medical supplier. Medicare and supplemental insurance pays for them with no deductible, but they seem to wear out a little sooner than I am eligible for a replacement.

This is the exact same OEM product but at a lower price.",7

Came one day early. Very nice.

Only issue I have is that it came in a previously open Phillips box with scotch tape on the top and bottom and the headgear was not in plastic. It was just placed in the box. Will disinfect and wash it. Not a sanitary way to repack this Amazon!",0

There is a new version of this headgear that has arms. Maybe that will work better, but it is $38. Won’t buy this version again.",1
24,11,7-Feb-20,"I tried a cheaper alternative, but it took less than a month for me to be sufficiently exasperated with that to go back to the original. Kind of expensive for what it is, but that can be said for all CPAP headgear. Wish it cost a little less, because it never lasts as long as Medicare thinks it will, so I periodically have to buy one out of pocket.",0

25,1,31-Jan-20,"Advantages over Facegel & even Nasal dreamwear is significant 1. The velcro need not be used everyday bcoz of the magnetic clasps and so the velcro which used to decide the end of life is no more going to degenerate by its use as there is no requirement to touch it 2. The nasal Dream wear used to generate a leak when u roll over on the sides whereas this Dreamwisp has a soft cup like the full face gelmask, but not so big and will not sit on the bridge of the nose - this just sits at the bottom tip of the nose and u dont get to feel it. Cons: the exhaust point in Nasal mask was on the point above the head where the mask starts whereas here, it is provided at the nasal cup and so partner will complain about the wisp of continuous air hitting their face. Overall, a STEP change and am very happy to have bought though i was afraid as there weren't any Indian reviews.",0
25,2,9-Jan-20,"I like this better than the dreamworks as there are no air leaks and I use it when my nose is sore from using my regular under the nose mask. I love that I can throw my tubing over the head of the bed and not have to police it like my usual mask, and that there is minimal pull felt by the tubing.",0
25,3,3-Sep-19,"I can't evaluate properly as I slept with the mask for only one night. That night was enough to know that this mask is absolutely not a good choice for anyone who has an ounce of a doubt of being a mouth breather. I have sinus issues, but lately I thought I was breathing manly from the nose. This mask proved me wrong. As soon as you mouth is open, air rushes out of your mouth instead of your air way. This will wake you up very frequently. Also, the pressure only applied to the nose made my mouth open up as soon as I fell asleep and muscles relax. On a side note, after that one night, I woke up with sore nose because of the pressure. That being said, that could have been an adjustment issue.",0
25,4,23-Aug-19,"This works well on my husbands CPAP. His last mask left his nose sore often, and also leaked air if he turned onto his side. This doesn't do either. It's a good, comfortable nose mask.",0

21,1,3-Dec-19,"I got the medium frame with three pillow sizes (small, medium and large). I think the medium nose pillows work for me. They are much more comfortable than my previous nose pillows (airsense P10). However the most important part is adjusting the tightness of the straps on the sides to make sure the nose pillows do not sit loosely on the nose. Once the straps are adjusted so that they are not too tight but firm enough to keep the nose pillows from slipping away, the mask becomes very secure and stays in place through out the night. I move a lot during my sleep so this mask which connects from the top is a blessing but you need to make sure the tubing that connects to the top has a little give so that you can move around. No other drawbacks that I can see so far after using this mask for a week. I am enjoying the gel pillows because they do not put any strain on the nose while still being firmly fixed and not moving. I would recommend this mask to someone who likes to move around in their sleep.",4
21,2,24-Oct-19,"That looks nice when I go first time purchase and comfort -BUT- it is too noisy for me when compare my original one which cover my nose only.
This is so noise since the tube is near my ear and I can't sleep well",1
23,1,26-Jan-20,"I originally started CPAP with a ResMed Airfit F20. It was horrible, I ended up with a massive blister which took ages to heal before being given this mask by my sleep clinic. Wow, it was amazing from day one but I did change from a medium mask to a small as there was leaking from the sides of my nose as the mask began to stretch. The only difference between the small mask and the medium is the cut out for the area the nose covers, every other part of the mask has the same dimensions. My advice is that if you are just over the small sizing go with the small and not the medium. I have successfully been using this mask now with my ResMed Airsense 10 with heated tube without any issues for nearly 2 years. I have never used any cushions or gauze between my mask and my face and I have never experienced any discomfort or skin sores unlike with previous masks. If it hadn’t been for this mask I very much doubt I could have continued with CPAP therapy as the other masks were just too uncomfortable. In fact I can’t get to sleep without the mask on. I can not fault this mask at all, thank you Philips for a design that allows you to read with your glasses on and be able to watch television whilst drifting off into a comfortable slumber. 10/10 for me!",0

Either way, both machines are quieter than the other machines I've tried and though worried about the noise, I have had a solid 9 hours sleep for the last week, using the Go while on our vacation. Fit into carryon luggage with no concerns about misplacing or damage while on the road. Great little machine!",0
19,10,17-Jan-20,I love the size and simplicity of this little fella. The problem is it is loud. You hear every breath amplified as the little holes for the air intake are so small it almost wheezes when you inhale. It's almost as irritating as the snoring was according to GF who has lived through both. Make bigger air intake ports and this could be the travel king!!,0
19,11,7-Jan-20,I purchased this in December and have used it for several weeks. It works as advertised and is a wonderful device to travel with. It works just like the larger PAP with the same setting flexibility. The phone App is primitive and needs to be updated to allow you to access more settings and data. I stopped using it. It would help if the manufacturer would provide more info on the X settings for other manufacturer's masks.,0

DreamWare's \\u201chow-could-that-possibly-work?\\u201d nasal cushion does indeed work wonderfully well for me.

The cushion is SO much more comfortable than nasal buds. And the mask leaves no marks on my face.

20,19,1580759704,"I purchased the DreamWear Nasal CPAP Mask with headgear on a recommendation from a coworker.  The mask has been a great purchase.  It is very comfortable.  I frequently sleep on my side and my previous nasal pillow mask was a challenge both in comfort and the nasal pillows didn't seal properly when on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only ""complaint"" about the Dreamwear Nasal CPAP mask is that I have a full beard and mustache and the nasal cushions pull on my mustache.  It takes a little bit of figiting to get it comfortable, but once I get it adjusted, it's perfect.  If I didn't have a mustache this would be a grand slam home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite feature to the mask is the inlet at the top of the head.  I toss and turn a bit while sleeping and this keeps the hose from wrapping around my neck.  Also the tube neck at the top of the head has exhaust holes for the excess air (instead of at the nasal pillow like my previous mask) so the air doesn't dump onto my face and hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nasal cushions must run large.  I use a medium nasal pillow mask on my old mask, I use a small nasal cushion on this mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, two enthusiastic thumbs up!",0

20,51,1567536368,"I have been using nasal pillow masks for years, but lately, the pillows have been irritating the skin on my nostrils.  I wanted to try this mask because rather than pillows, it uses a cushion with a slot that sits under the nostrils.  I will say that it is comfortable.  However, it's very noisy, to the point that it was waking me earlier than I would normally have awakened.  I think the noise was coming from air going through the hollow mask frame; I'm not certain.  But something was loud.  Since the cushion seemed to be seated and sealed properly under my nose, I don't think the noise was coming from the cushion.  Regardless, I couldn't tolerate the noise.  Also, my BiPAP machine feedback was indicating a lot of hypopneas.  And I was still getting irritation on my nostrils.  Now I'm not saying that other people will have these same problems, although I don't see how anyone could NOT have the noise problem, unless I had a defective mask.  But I saw no flaws in any of the mask components.  I'm not giving it one star, because there are positive things about the mask, such as the comfort, and ease of assembly\\/disassembly.",1

20,53,1565740818,"I wanted to love this mask. I do like the minimal design, and the fact that you can see clearly with it on. I so WISH it worked in practice! My three main objections were the ease with which the mask \\/ headgear slips OFF my head if I move, the limiting of the air flow, and the noise. The headgear strap is too high on the head to be effective in keeping the mask in place. It slips around or off of my head every time I move, so I feel like I'm fighting it every time I move. With the air rushing through the frame itself, when laying on my side, the sound of the air rushing through the portion of the mask under my head is noisy AND there are times I'd wake up feeling like I was suffocating from the lack of air flow. The opening at my nose was not being obstructed, but the air was not flowing through as it should. This mask is far noiser than my previous Respironics True Blue Gel mask. Since the mask won't stay on and is noisy, I'll be returning it. Maybe a future generation of this mask will have a headgear design that keeps it on better.. Keep in mind, I'm a side sleeper. I think people who sleep on their backs and don't move much would find this mask effective, but it's not the mask for me!",0
20,54,1565668796,"This design is far superior to the previous headgear I had. The nasal pillow does not go up into the nostril, but cradles the nose and manages to seal well. The hose attaching on top makes all the difference when turning over. I couldn\\u2019t be happier with this. Also, the fit is such that I no longer have indentions in my cheeks when I wake up.",0

20,56,1565183540,"The mask is what makes using a CPAP sustainable. I have only had this unit. It seems comfortable enough, it works very well if sleeping on my back. It leaks quite abit if I lay on my side. I may try a few other to see what works best.",0

20,58,1562252486,"I went through a dozen different masks when I was first fitted for a CPAP and kept coming back to this one. I sleep mixed back and side. This one works great for side sleeping. This particular mask comes as a kit - you order the correct size frame (I wear a medium) - and it comes with the 4 different nose pieces - S, M, MW & L. I've been getting M for the last year and tried out the MW (Medium-Wide) - wow what a difference, my sleep scores are much better. Go figure. I combine this mask with a So Clean and can get 6 months easy out of the mask with just having to replace the suspension strap as it stretches out - easy $18 part. From my local provider this mask is about 2.5x more than the cash price at CPAP.com - can't imagine buying it anywhere else now.",0

20,68,1553046865,"With past nasal masks, the part of the cushion that went inside of my nose injured the skin at times, and often caused pain as my skin was rubbed and became sore.  This new nasal mask just has the nose resting on the cushion (with air hole), so no part is inside the nose.  In addition, I'm able to sleep in any position, even on my stomach, my preferred sleep position. Finally, the composition of the cushion is strong, so each nasal cushion is lasting a long time.  That's not true for the DreamWear full face mask\\u2014the face cushions are done in less than two weeks, I've found.  So instead, I'm really happy with the DreamWear Nasal CPAP Headgear, and CPAP.com sold the whole outfit for a very reasonable price!",1

Also very noisy as the air tubes run right next to your ear.  The mask was fairly comfortable to wear and may work well for a back sleeper.  I'm in the process of returning and trying option number 2.",0
20,70,1552007272,I really really want to be able to use this mask because it is very comfortable. As long as it stays on my head which it doesn't because the flimsy nonadjustable headgear keeps slipping off. But that isn't my biggest problem. Although this mask gets great reviews very few people complain about the noise as the air rushes through the air supply tubes that lie alongside your skull. But for me the noise is a deal breaker. I have also seen other reviews from people that just cannot stand the loud rushing noise so I'm not alone in experiencing this problem. This noise gets worse if you sleep on your side because then the air can only pass through one tube so the velocity and noise increases. I really struggle with other masks that either leak or hurt and this one does neither. So I keep coming back to this mask to give it another try but usually only last a few hours before getting up and putting my usual but leaky mask back on. I even wrapped the air tubes in sheepskin seat belt covers which made my wife almost hurt herself from laughing so hard. It helped lessen the noise but the mask slipped off even more. I have contacted Philips Customer Service twice for advice and to let them know I was having problems but have never received a response. I even posted bad reviews but still no response. For that reason alone I will probably never buy a Philips CPAP product.,1

When you go to reorder, the cheapest option is the fit pack with all the different size cushions, obviously I only need one size cushion so the other 3 just get throwed away, a total waste.  There should be an option to get 4 of the same size cushions since no one is gonna be using 4 different sizes once they know which one fits them.  If you order all the parts separately it costs more and you only get one cushion.  Also the strap that is referred to as the headgear is not good.  It looses it's elasticity quickly, doesn't last the 6 months til recommended replacement of the mask and to order another strap (headgear) is $30.  Ridiculous price for a strap that will not last.",1

I do not like to use masks that touch the bridge of my nose. And this eliminates that. The only flaw is that I have to wear my hair in a ponytail placed above the strap around my head. It will slip off and I need the pony to keep it in place. And now I am having hair issues due to sleeping with a rubber band in my hair every night.,1

20,104,1542119121,I have used this mask for a few nights after 3 months of using the Wisp. Tonight I am going back to the Wisp. It\\u2019s supposed to be cleaned daily and that requires removing the cloth frame and I have had a very hard time getting it to fit well. Every night I wake up and have to push the straps on the back of my head down. This wakes me up several times per night. If I loosen the straps it creates large leaks. Last night my boyfriend said it sounded like I was on life support. Ive has to sleep on my back because it pushes sideways when I\\u2019m on my side and creates gaps. Unfortunately I\\u2019ll be returning this mask,0

(not the case with a full face mask)  Suddenly my events per night are almost zero.  And my compliance is thru the roof.  Thank the Lord almighty!  P.S.

The location of the air tube is much better in my opinion.  You won't have the same tugging issues that other masks give with the tube located below.  This mask feels so light, that it is almost like wearing nothing.  The interesting thing about this is that it doesn't put anything in your nostril like some CPAP ""nasal pillows"".  It just rests under your nose and stays with no leakage.  I wouldn't expect this to work as well as it did.  I primarily sleep on my back, but turn on my side later on during the night.

20,146,1521816071,The DreamWear mask is more confortable than a mask with nasal pillows. The down side is the DreamWear mask is louder than other masks I have tried. If you lie on your side the tubing will partically colapse redirecting the airflow to the other side of the mask causing increased air velocity resulting in more noise.,1
20,147,1521809079,Comfortable product.  Your service of sending the nasal packets helped with the sizing. Mobility is much better than other products I used in the past. Soft plastic material which will not create chaffing to around nose area.; although the rubber band that goes around the head is comfortable it pull hair.

20,148,1521726788,"So far, I am very pleased.  No noise issue with the air coming through the side straps.  This was an experiment to see if I could avoid a full mask and not start breathing through my mouth.  It works.  The air pressure coming through the nose seems to encourage keeping my mouth closed.  So much less invasive. Also, the hose on top rather than in front makes it easy to read in bed with the mask just before falling asleep.  Will definitely keep it.",0
20,149,1521114635,"I can't imagine a better mask. This statement is from a mouth breather. I have been using a full face masks for about a year and I hated them. The full face mask would bruise my nose, leak, limit my movement and worst of all bloat my belly unimaginably. This last complaint is the worst because my belly discomfort would wake me up in the middle of the night for a couple of hours until it subsided. I don't know how I knew but I knew I was somehow swallowing air through my mouth and if I could only wear a different mask, one on my nose, things would be different. My doctor had zero answers for this condition. \\r\\nNow as I said I am a mouth breather and my lower jaw is going to fall back, and no amount of chin straps or mouth guards can stop it. However, I have hit on a combination that keeps my jaw in place enough to allow me to wear this mask. A doctor would probably not recommend this approach but it works for me. What I do is put a strip of medical tape across my mouth to keep my lips together and then I use Dr Dakota's chin wedge placed around my neck, preventing to a large degree my jaw from opening and falling back into my throat. It is still more of a hassle than not having any mask at all, but I am sleeping better, I have no leaks with this mask, I can move around and sleep in any position, and I no longer get any kind of bloating whatsoever. The only negative about it is that when I wake up my mouth is dry. \\r\\nMy last comments about this mask are these: it was very easy to adjust to fit. It took maybe two minutes working with it to get the right fit. It fits lightly on my face, meaning the straps can be surprisingly loose. I am surprised the straps can be so loose but still allow for any position sleeping and not leak. And lastly according to my Dream Mapper app I experience zero to maybe two hypopneas at night now compared to a much higher rate with a full face mask. I cannot recommend this mask enough.",1
20,150,1521055364,This is the second mask that I have tried and it is a keeper! I am a side sleeper and having the hose come out the back makes sleeping a lot more comfortable. No more hose in my way all the time; now I don't even know it is there. The mask is also much more comfortable than the nose pillows I was using before. They would cause me irritation and redness and this mask doesn't do that at all. Highly recommend!,2
20,151,1520650546,I have a waterbed and this works fine.  It's so heavy duty I don't think it will ever need replacement.  I've been on CPAP therapy for a little over a year.  I wish I would have gotten this sooner.  Until now the hose was a big problem.  Wrapped it around my neck or arms frequently.  Pulled the machine onto the floor once and inadvertently disconnected the hose many times.  With this device I have back freedom of movement.  Can roll from front to either side with no problems.

Mine just lays behind my pillow where it can be ignored.  Secondly, it doesn't leave marks on your face.  It's frustrating when you have strap marks for hours after you take your CPAP mask off.  The few times I have noticed any strap marks, they were minor and disappeared in a short time.  Thirdly, it's really comfortable.  I have tried nasal prongs and hated them.  After a few days, my nostrils became irritated, even after trying the different sizes included.  And even the wisp, when slightly displaced during sleep, can leak air and hiss.

Not sure why anyone would not love this but I got my first cpap in early October 17 and it\\u2019s been a nightmare trying to sleep. I first got a nasal pillow from company my insurance provided and it made my nose really sore. I thought about trying the dream wear and they told ne I should try a full face. The other thing is that during ramp up the air kept blowing my mouth open and I woke up every night. Went to full face and it was worse. Absolutely hated it. Insurance will not let me change again until the end of January.  No way I wanted to wait until end of January with a full face that long. To buy the dream wear from company insurance making me work with $150. Again not sure if I was going to like it without giving a try. Did an extensive search and found cpap.com.  So glad I did. Got the new mask in just a few days and I love it!   The head piece fits great and it\\u2019s adjustable.  I read some said it\\u2019s noisy. I sure do not think so. I can sleep on my side again. Not crazy about hose on top of head but better than other way. It\\u2019s very soft and zero issue with it sealing. I am a med size woman the small nose piece with med headgear is perfect.

20,192,1512675121,"I like how lightweight this assembly is and the hose swivel on top of my head. But the head strap only mounts to two places, so there's nothing to keep it from sliding on the back of my head. That changes the fit of the mask, and unless the mask is positioned perfectly, I can't breathe. I tried hair clips to keep the head strap in place, but that was only marginally effective.",2
20,193,1512576328,"I sent it back after only one night, the worst night of sleep in months.  The head strap is also the air tube.  All night I got to listen to the air rushing through the strap\\/tube.  And the seal on the nostrils wasn't great either.",3

Head gear seems to slip. 2). When breathing the sound can be carried thru the passages on the headgear which can be a distraction. Control the breathing a little and it is really good.",2

I Tried this new mask only because it came with free return insurance.  I had to play with the different sizes to find the one that worked for me and the strap adjustments as well.  I love it!

I had to double up the Velcro straps to get it tight enough to seal the cushion tmy face, but the tightness hurts on the back of my head since I sleep on my back. It took a couple of tries to find the right cushion.  The little exhale slit gives off a high pitched hiss.  Designer should consider using a pinhole instead. If you have even a slight runny nose, it doesn't seal and the rainout makes as hissing noise.",3

Love the soft nose piece that rests below the nose and doesn't swell my nose the way pillows do with the fairly high pressure setting I need. Also, the wrapped straps leave no marks on my face.

20,229,1503432136,The nasal pillows are too soft so they move around enough to require constant adjustment. May I suggest nasal pillows be made of less flexing material that extends into the nostrils a bit to keep them in place. The side delivery air tubes are excellent.,5

I have a huge head, so the Medium may be a bit small for me - as such, I do have problems keeping a good seal in place.  But that's a small price to pay to be able to enjoy having so much less appliance pressing on my face.  I definitely recommend this product",4
20,232,1502044005,Apparently I and several others are of the same opinion... The air tubes on the side of the face are just too loud. Stick your head in a jet engine and nighty night? I couldn't do it... Back it goes.,9
20,233,1501945986,I received this very quickly and used it the first night and every night since.  It is very comfortable and much lighter than the previous nose pillow headware that I was using.  No metal parts.  You might have to try different size cushions until you feel right.,6

EZ to clean, and take apart, reassemble. Love this, and will get more.",2

My pressure is 19 which was too high for most of the non tight fitting masks.  Plus with the covers that come with the mask there is barely any indentation or mark on my face when I get up.  I have a whole box of nasal masks I have tried and I can now throw them all away.,3

Its comfortable, and it doesn't leak. It really works. I have been using the Swift FX for several years, and I love that mask too. The only downside of the DreamWear headgear is that I hear air noise in the nose piece. The Swift FX is quieter. But the advantage of the DreamWear headgear is it eliminates hassling with hose throughout the night.

I see that the mask comes with gel nasal pillows - I may try that, but unfortunately that version does not come with insurance.  Other than that it fit fine and and worked well.",2

20,260,1496154782,"The overall design concept is great.....get the hose out of your nightly routine.   I believe the manufacturer went the easy route of fabricating the whole assembly of one material, a very soft rubbery material.  If you just sleep on your back (and then having freedom from the hose is not as much an issue) then it would work just fine.  However, when you sleep on one side or the other, the soft tubing crushes under the weight of your head and you lose about a third of the pressurized air feed to your face.  The fix would be to make the feed tubes that go down either side of your head of a harder material that will not collapse so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other negative is a smaller issue but also part of the manufacturer's conscious decision to make fabrication process easier.  The air vents directly straight out from the front of the nasal piece.  So you wind up spraying your spouse with a fine column of air during the night.  It took my wife by surprise the first night I had it on.",8

The bottom strap slides up my head and I half wake several times a night to pull it back down.  I have tried a pony tail, and the strap slides right over it.

20,294,1491482012,"I love this mask, I can finally see things again with the mask on.  Its light and easy to use and works well.",1
20,295,1491416585,I have used 4 masks in the past year. I started with a full mask which constantly leaked. Then I went to nasal pillow masks and they hurt my nose and caused irritation. The Dreamweaver is excellent. Extremely comfortable and well designed. Virtually no leakage. I sleep through the night now and the have no irritation on my nose. Sleeping happily now.,4
20,296,1491134127,"I bought this to replace the Nuance Pro I was given months ago, which had been awful.  It leaked when I moved, blowing tornadic winds into my eyes and waking me.  The parts that went up my nostrils caused me to feel bruised and irritated, also waking me.  And the cold damp air through the unheated tube made my sinuses ache.  I had quit using the cpap two months ago for these reasons.  This new ""mask"" has none of those problems.  It is easy to adjust, doesn't move when I do, and doesn't leak.  I bought a heated tube also and that has eliminated the frozen sinus problem.  These two changes in equipment have improved the usefulness from 0 to 10!",5
20,297,1490976859,I am a side sleeper and can only sleep on my back for so long. This mask is very comfortable when sleeping on my side or in any position for that matter. It doesn't irritate my nostrils as it doesn't actually rest inside the opening of the nose. It takes a little getting used to to have the hose on the top of the head but over time this is more comfortable as well and doesn't get tangled up when shifting from back to side positions.,6
20,298,1490797044,"This is a pretty good mask,, took some time getting used to the fit and feel.  Very different having the tube coming off the top of head instead of your face, big improvement.  There is a slight air leak sound that is part of the design where the tube connects, but doesn't bother me while sleeping.  Don't miss the strap marks on my face either, can sleep in either side, getting better sleep!",2

It causes leak problems for many masks except the Dream Wear Nasal Mask. The simplicity of the design yields great result. It works very effectively and yet very comfortable. I wear it 24\\/7 and perform all my normal daily activities including driving except taking a daily shower with the Oxygen supplement. I spare extra set of this mask to allow cleaning and ware.,6
20,303,1490106222,"The DreamWear Mask allows me to read while wearing.  It fits well and is comfortable while in bed face down reading.  It is a little less stable when on your side, however, a little tweaking of the head strap and your good to go from side to side.  It is very nice to have the feed hose come from the top and not in front.",5
20,304,1489853731,"This mask is very comfortable and stable on my face, but the air rushing through the tubes right next to my ears was too noisy.  Also, the exhalation port on the front doesn't diffuse the air as much as most, which is also noisy if you sleep on your side and it blows against a pillow or blanket.",8
20,305,1489757982,"As comfortable as a mask can get I imagine. I am new to the cpap world but it seems like it must be the least invasive and cumbersome mask.  It doesn't cover one's entire face like some others do so you can sip water in the night, fits comfortably, is airtight,  light weight and quiet. Good for tummy\\/side sleepers as smooth, pliant sides. Minimum face marks and bed head hair in the morning. Can't imagine using any other.",8

20,309,1489168753,"I like the compactness of the DreamWear Nasal CPAP Mask and that the air hose connection it at the top of the frame. But, I had problems with the elbow connection to the air hose at the top of the frame. Because it is an elbow connection, the air hose cannot go straight over the top of the pillow. It either bends down catching on the pillow or turns to the sides causing the mask to tighten. It works fine if you have the air hose go across the pillow and off the side of the bed but my air hose goes off the top of the bed. I checked to see if there was a straight connection piece for the hose to connect to the frame but none are available.",7
20,310,1489113167,This mask is so lightweight and nice. But I could not keep it under my nostrils while sleeping. Tried all configurations and would not stay in place.,5

Not sure if I will return it yet, since it does help with the soreness I've have with the nasal pillows.",3
20,312,1489072468,"With the air flowing passed my ears this mask is so loud that I could not sleep. Also with the elbow on the top with soft rubber under it, it felt like a rock on the top of my head. Glad this came with a money back warranty.",9

20,315,1488555748,Easy to sleep with on.  Comfortable - and it doesn't scare my pets like the mask does lol.,4
20,316,1488490192,This has been the most comfortable nose pillow mask that I have ever used. It does have a higher rate of moving and leaking while in use but that is such a small price to pay for the comfort that this provides. Anyone who uses a nose pillow type mask I would recommend this to replace it.,2
20,317,1488474684,"The mask fit is good, using the small nasal attachment. The only issue i have is the fact that the head gear constantly slips  on my head at night. I have it adjusted across the back of my head but it keeps slipping. Have to use clips to attach headgear to my hair.",1

20,321,1488046168,"The very first mask (Profile gel) and headgear I had when I got my first CPAP around 15 years ago were perfect. I slept like a baby for several years with them. Suddenly, when I ordered replacements, the headgear was different and I have never been able to find headgear that stay on my head! I was complaining to my sleep doctor last month that I have tried several new styles and it has been very expensive trying things that just don't work. He recommended the DreamWear and said he has patients who really like it. Because cpap.com is so good about returns, I decided to try it. I have used my new mask and headgear for 3 nights now and I think I am going to like it! I like that I can try the various sizes, and the units are easy to swap out. I will be interested to see how long the headgear goes before stretching out, but I hope this is finally it!",5

That move really improved my sleep and minimized the leaks. Trouble was, the mask left me with a very sore nose around the bridge. So I tried the DreamWear mask, and it's awesome! Minimal leaks, no sore bridge. Deep sleep. I couldn't be happier. As a physician, I understand how critical compliance becomes for those of us with apnea, and this product goes a long way to achieving that goal!",8

20,344,1484750351,"I used to have nasal masks and the area around my nose was red all the time.  So then I went to the pillow masks, which were much better, but, especially the ones that the hose comes out of one side, when sleeping on the side, would push the pillow against the inside of the nose and I would wake up with an extremely sore nose. This mask with just an opening for both nostrils, I think is the answer.  This is the second one I have bought and I love it.",3
20,345,1484587494,"I really like the fit, especially compared to my full-face mask. In the morning when I  woke up and checked the sleep report, I saw that there was no air leakage in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, I have a relatively high pressure setting and the cannula blew all the air directly into my nostrils with great force. I woke up before morning with my membranes dried out and irritated. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs much as I like the way it fits and feels on the outside, it just won't work for me on the inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo glad it came with free return insurance!",3

The Dreamwear mask is light weight, made of soft materials, and sits unrestricted on my face and is hardly detectable as I sleep.  After 12 years of searching, I finally found the mask that works for me.",2
20,348,1483673046,"The DreamWear CPAP Mask is a very comfortable and less intrusive than other masks, however the clear challenge is fit.  If you sleep on your back and never move it is great.  The issue is if you change positions so does the mask and it is easy for the seal to be broken.  I heard this complaint about this unit and it is legitimate.  I am still trying to make this work because the comfort is worthy of the challenge.  Wearing the various size nose pieces through trial and error is the only way I got to a better place.  Even though several nights sleep was sacrificed in the process, it is worth it to get to the appropriate fitting mask.",10

This mask is more comfortable, does not leave indentations and with hose attached up top with the quick release connection; moves better as i move a lot in my sleep. With this mask can just reach up and disconnect the hose if need to go to bathroom and then just pop back on. I got for my wife because her old mask always left indentations on her face ( take a while to fade away ) and of course if you roll over in sleep have issue with hose.

I was a little worried since it leaks a little but I wake up refreshed an my AHI and all those indexes are as good or better than the mirage et al. I like CPAP.com but wish they wouldn't price it better, now its just a suggested retail thats the same for the fit kit and the minimal replacement ; you have to call if you want a better price.

I am not fighting with the tube in the middle of the night trying to get comfortable. I have the ability to roll over on my stomach if I so choose. Rubs a little under my nose, would be my only complaint, but its only been a few days and I am still playing with it to make it as comfortable as possible. Other than that definitely a good mask!!!",1

The hose outlet on the top did take a little getting used to and I do use a hose hanger, but it is great to not have a hose draped over my neck or chest. The change I would suggest for this design is to add an option for a chin strap. I currently wear a chin strap under it, but it looks like the design could accommodate this feature easily. No mask is perfect for everybody, but this one works really well for me.",0
20,388,1478821062,"I've only been on xPAP therapy for about 6 weeks, but this is the 4th mask I've tried. For comparison, I first tried the ResMed P10 nasal pillow, which just didn't fit right for the shape of my nose and caused a lot of irritation. Then I tried the F10 full face mask, and quickly concluded that full face masks are not for me (claustrophobia, jaw discomfort, etc.). Finally, I tried the Opus 360 nasal pillow, which was tolerable but still fairly uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like the DreamWear better than all of these. It's a lot more comfortable because I don't have anything IN my nose, which I find extremely irritating. I do feel it resting on my cheekbones slightly, but it's nothing compared to the annoying way the Opus 360 hits my cheeks. And I love that the hose attaches to the top of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy main complaint is the sizing of the pillows. The sizing card that comes with the mask recommended a medium for me. I get a good seal when I use the medium, but I don't feel like I'm getting enough air, like too much of my nostrils are blocked off. I've been using a large instead, which does give me enough air, but it's a challenge to get it to seal completely. I have long, narrow, not-very-flared nostrils, and the opening on the large might be just a little bit too wide. My nose does cover it completely, but just barely. I have ended up tightening the headgear probably a bit too much in order to improve the seal, which increases the pressure on my cheekbones. I think an additional pillow size for longish narrow noses would be a great additional option.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, I haven't seen any other masks that seem like they could possibly be as comfortable as this one, so I'll be sticking with it for now.",5

I was disappointed to find out that my style of mask was being discontinued.  The folks here at CPAP.COM recommended I try the DreamWear.  I was skeptical at first.  Night one, I lasted half the night and went back to my old mask.  Night two, I slept with the DreamWear the whole night and have ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm a stomach and side sleeper.  No more leaks and no more pushing of a hard plastic mask against my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend you try this mask!",3

I did get the wrong type for my needs and ended up sending it back after 5 days of use. \\r\\nHowever for those that want or need a nasal mask, it is comfortable while on your back. Slightly uncomfortable if you sleep on your side. It tended to leak a little more. Very easy to adjust and clean.",1

20,399,1477658584,I really love this mask but since I'm a mouth breather I have to first affix a chin strap first. The problem is I wear a medium head gear and cushion but with a chin strap under the Dream Wear is too tight but a large head gear doesn't fist on the head where it should and I refuse to tape my mouth shut. I'm going to try the Amara View which is the same cushion with the addition of mouth breathing capability.,0

Prior to this I had been using the AirFit P10 nasal pillows successfully and liked them (still do) a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo my surprise, I found that I am having almost no leaks other than those expected by the mask.  In the 10+ years I have been using CPAP, I have never experienced such low leak levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mask is slightly less comfortable than the Airfit P10, but still comfortable.  I did not think I would like having  the hose connect on top of my head, but found I like it better.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I used the large P10 nasal pillows, I am undecided whether to use the medium or small DreamWear pillows.  If you order this mask, I suggest you buy the one that includes all pillow sizes.  You may be surprised which one fits you best.",7
20,402,1477572971,"I've been having problems for years finding the right mask due to being mostly a side sleeper.  Either the mask moves, or the hard plastic parts of the mask dig into my face somewhere or the headgear isn't flexible enough to allow side sleeping.  This mask has fixed ALL of that.  Since the mask itself is all soft plastic and no hard pieces there is nothing to dig into and since the mask itself is also the side straps I hardly notice they are there when on my side.  The whole thing is very minimal.  As a bonus with the air tube connecting at top instead of in front the pesky in your face air tube is gone.  Please don't ever discontinue this!\\r\\n\\r\\nI can finally sleep again.",9

Love the tubing location on top of head, and side straps that minimize denting on checks, but after two days of wearing I had a pressure point that formed under my nose that kept getting worse and had to discontinue using the mask.

Leaks don't seem to be a problem. Breathing (exhaling) is a little difficult at times, but this may be because I have the nosepiece positioned where it partially blocks the exhalation port (easy to do this, unfortunately).

This mask is more comfortable, quieter, and leaves little to no marking on my face in the morning.  I found the nasal opening a bit odd compare to other masks, but it was easy to get used to, very comfortable, and did not impede airflow.  The ""top of head"" connection was excellent for a stomach sleeper who tosses and turns a lot, and resulted in little to no fussing with hose position during the night. On some nights, I did struggle a bit maintaining the proper fit. The proper headgear position at the top of your head tended to slide forward and dislodge the mask.  Tightening the straps to prevent this caused too much compression on my nose, in my opinion.  I tried this mask along with the Swift FX Nasal pillows mask, Nuance & Nuance Pro Nasal Pillows, and AirFit P10.  This mask was my second choice.  Compared to my first choice, the AirFit, this mask is bulkier (but not bad!) and noiser when something (like a pillow or spouse's head) gets close to the exiting airflow.",5

No weird sounds from leakage at night. Only one issue. I can't sleep on my side because it does break the seal a little. I have a cervical pillow so it may not leak with a regular pillow. I'm also mostly a back sleeper so this is not a big issue for me.",2

Generally speaking I find it preferable to the Swift FX (with nasal prongs that tend to distort the nose by morning).   While having the hose attach at the top of the head is a clear improvement I dearly miss the Swift FX's additional 12""+ hose length.  The DreamWear often pulls off my head when I sit up.",3

My Resmed machine shows that my seal is very good.       I am able to leave the head strap very loose on my head and the mask still works well.    I like not having something hanging from my face so I find the swivel on the top of the head comfortable and functional.    I have only 7 days on this setup and have not used other masks except during my sleep study.     But I am very happy and think this is an ergonomic design.,0

When I first got it, it looked like it wouldn't work, but it does.  The top-mount hose seemed too heavy at first but no problem after getting used to it.  I can't put my head right up against the headboard, though, you need a little space there for it.  I have had two previous ResMed nasal pillow masks (Swift) and although those were good, I like this better so far, and yes, less marks on my face in the morning.  The strap around the back of my head rides up some in the night and then I'll get a leak and have to pull it down, but this happened with the Swift also and I think it's the shape of my head.  I don't see it as a design flaw.",3

There is a bit of airflow on side sleeping, but I could probably adjust mask and it would be perfect.

The DreamWear is my new favorite mask - I like that I can comfortably sleep on my side with no leakage and that it really puts no pressure on either my nose or my jaw. Having the hose coming off the head took a little getting used to, but I find that as long as I have enough slack up at the top (and sometimes tuck a bit of the hose under my pillow), it doesn't pull on the top of the mask. 5 stars!",4

A true innovative solution and a departure from the usual heavy headgear configurations that make you feel like you have a bear trap on your head.\\r\\nThe hose connection placement on the top of the head keeps the hose out of the way completely.  The dual feed hoses on the side of the head ensure a constant flow of air reaches the nasal mask.  It's light and the closest thing to wearing nothing at all....and it stays in place!!

20,488,1468931750,I've been using different pillow masks for the last dozen years.  I've had this mask for a week and for the first time ever the app shows zero leaks every night.  That never happened before so I'm delighted.  It's also very comfortable and having the swivel hose connection on top of my head makes turning over a breeze.,6

20,491,1468615516,"Recently ordered the dreamwear nasal CPAP.  Very pleased! I've been wearing a nasal wisp the past couple years.  It seems with allergies and the wisp pinching my nose slightly there were times it was difficult to fall asleep.  The dreamwear has resolved that issue.  I find it very comfortable, even when sleeping on my side.  There is a little more air noise with the added vent at the elbow\\/hose attachment at the top of your head.  It hasn't bothered my wife but I do hear it occasionally if sleeping lightly.  The comfort of the fit makes up for that. \\r\\nAlso I would like to thank my sales agent (sorry I don't remember her name).  She was very helpful and had great answers and suggestions throughout our call.\\r\\nThank you CPAP.com!",4

20,496,1468100148,"I did fine with my old nose\\/mouth gel mask, so wasn't certain if I should change, but this DreamWear mask is really much better- less intrusive, easy fit with fewer straps to untangle or wear out. Just pull it on easy and go to sleep. I rotate at night-sleep on both sides and my back- and this mask gave me no problems-very comfortable. But I was used to having the hose on my nose mask come in from over my head. It was a new experience the first night until I fell asleep, but now I wouldn't go back to my old mask. I think it's time for a nap now.",4

If anyone knows of a good mask please let me know.,1

20,500,1467926656,"This is nearly great, with 2 out of 3 things right. The third is a fail. \\r\\nFirst the great: \\r\\n1. I love the innovative design of passing the air through the harness. This is a great idea which moves the hose and vent away from your face.\\r\\n2. The hose connection AND the exhaust vent are moved to top of the head!. I once kludged a hose to do the same thing. This moves the exhaust away from your nose and face to where it should be. Great!\\r\\nAnd now the fail - \\r\\n3. the ""nose flute"" design for the nose pieces. Air is supposed to go in your nose from upward facing slots that you rest your nose on. This is very hard to fit and just didn't work for my high pressure (14).\\r\\nMy suggestion to Philips is to adapt the nose pillows of the Swift FX to the flow-through design of the DreamWear. That be an awesome combination.\\r\\nAnother minor complaint, PR should include a small lightweight hose, similar to the Swift FX, to provide a more flexible connection to your main hose.\\r\\nFor now, this sits unused.",7

20,502,1467729148,A great [?]mask ??--pricey but worth it .,1
20,503,1467722783,Very satisfied with this new mask.  The swivel at top of head allows changing positions without the hose pulling out of place.  The nasal part stays in place when you roll over and does not cause air leakage.  Very happy after a week of use!,3

Sometimes I go to sleep on my side, this works.  Sometimes I spoon up against the most awesome wife in the world, this works.  Reading or TV, THIS WORKS GREAT.  Back sleepers, this is awesome.

This mask is the best I have tried and is a real keeper. It is very light and unobtrusive. Almost feels like nothing is on my face. Allows complete freedom of movement and leaves no mask lines. Easy to put on and take off. Delivers effective therapy in all sleep positions. I am permanently switching to this mask. I did have to remove my insulated hose cover. This mask,headgear and supply hose is actually so light the hose cover weighs it down too much.",2
20,511,1466869117,"I have found this mask to be the best fit for me even with a thick mustache. It has been great for reading and watch TV because my vision is not obstructed by the high profile of the face mask. Also, it seems to have no leakage around the edges maintaining a higher pressure and assuring my comfort during a deeper sleep.",1

It doesn't have anything sticking inside your nostrils to get on your nerves. The headgear is minimal but stays put and the hose connection is on top and stays out of the way  and to the back of your head when you move. It also offers a quick release from the hose so if you have to get up, you don't have to take it off your face. No marks on my face plus fabric wraps for the side for added comfort. It's awesome!",8

20,525,1465744280,"I have been using this new DreamWear nasal mask for close to a month now and it is quite ingenious. I find myself still grabbing for the old head straps to adjust and they're not there. It's a very smart design as it allows air to fill the very comfortable band. I didn't think I could get used to the nasal mask after using a traditional ""cover your whole nose"" mask for so long but this product made it easy because the nose piece just rests comfortably below your nose. The air flow keeps it tight and there is virtually no adjusting necessary even when I roll over.  Highly recommended and worth the money.",10
20,526,1465684063,"The DreamWear mask couldn't be more comfortable, and the fit-pack allows easy selection of the proper cushion. The mask stays in place for a good seal, even when side-sleeping, and leaves no red marks on my face. It is very easy to clean.

I could never get it to fit comfortably, to tight to loose. I could not lay on my side because of the bulk of the mask along my face. most of the time when it starting feeling good  it leaked badly. All in all I sent it back.",9
20,529,1465650195,I saw no improvement over my current mask.  I was lead to believe the air bleed hole would be from the top of my head rather than from my face.  It is still on the front of the mask where it blows in my wife's face when I sleep.  I sent the mask back.,4
20,530,1465649004,Just doesn't do it because there are no nasal pillows and the top connection just flops around.,4
20,531,1465416826,I have tried many masks and this is the one I will stick with.  I've been using this one for about a week now.  I like that it is soft and it doesn't leave strap marks on my face.  I like where the hose attachment is located.  The only drawback to it is my climate control hose is heavy and I haven't figured out how to rig it where the weight of the hose doesn't pull on the mask when I move around.,2

20,534,1465327975,"I tried the Dreamwear mask in my sleep Dr. office and seemed perfect -- -lightweight and easy to use.  But in practice (6 nights), it just would not stay in place.  Unlike a mask that covers the nose, any slippage with this mask meant no air to breathe.  I think the problem is the design of the headgear.  I finally gave up in frustration and returned it.",3
20,535,1465068579,The DreamWear Nasal CPAP Mask is the most comfortable I've had.  It gets the hose up and out of the way and the mask does not get dislodged and start leaking when I move around or lay on my side.  I definitely recommend this mask.,2

20,537,1464904794,"I have used the mask off and on for the past couple of months.  While it is very comfortable and a wonderful concept, I am not totally sold on it's effectiveness (for me).  It seemed to work some nights and not others.  It might be that my sinus challenges (one nostril is partially or fully plugged most every night), limits the effectiveness of a very compact (small) mask.  I keep going back to the Respironics Comfort Gel Nasal Mask as it has given me the most consistent quality of sleep and is also very comfortable to wear \\/ use.  The DreamWear Mask might be excellent for someone without my sinus problems.",5
20,538,1464788846,Love this DreamWear! Very comfortable mask.,1
20,539,1464709600,I have never reviewed a product in my life but after 25 years of CPAP use and over a hundred masks used I finally found it!! The design that takes the hose out of the way so you don't have to reposition it each time you move is perfect. The comfort level is off the charts.  The nose piece doesn't leak and is so comfortable that it has never interrupted my sleep. In short it is the best mask I have ever owned and will continue to use it as long as it is available. Buy one you will not be sorry.,9
20,540,1464640804,"This is a very elegant design.  It is also very easy to read with glasses on while wearing the mask.  However, the big downside for me was that there is no mask which covers your nose.  The air intake needs to rest up against your nostrils.  I kept worrying that the it would get displaced from my nostrils because I sleep on my side with my head on its side buried in a pillow.  When I woke up in the middle of the night on the first night I tried it, the sound of my breathing was very loud, I think because of the masks closeness to my nostrils, so I took it off and went back to my old mask.  It also requires daily cleaning for the nostril touching part and a weekly cleaning of the airpaths.  Because this mask my work for other people without my issues, I gave it an average rating.",3
20,541,1464636388,"I bought this Philips DreamWear mask to replace a competitor's nasal mask that I have used for a year. The Philips mask is lighter in weight, less bulky, and much easier to put on and take off. Having the air port at the top of the head makes it easier to turn over in bed without tangling the hose. The design of the cushion (nosepiece), which covers only the nostrils and tip of the nose, is less bulky and less restrictive, and hence less ""claustrophobic"". I have not been bothered by the excessive noise that other reviewers have noted. My only complaint is that it has more air leakage than my previous mask (10 to 18 L\\/min vs 0 to 4 L\\/min), though this has not adversely affected my apnea rate.",6
20,542,1464406653,"Ok, so I really dislike having to use any of this equipment, but I guess using it and living is better than the alternative. This is the best answer to a mask I have had. It delivers the air with the least discomfort of any I have tried previously, and I have tried a few.",0
20,543,1464365297,Works better than I thought.  It fits perfect and is easy to remove and replace in the dark.  Much quieter than the old classic unit.  I love it.,3
20,544,1464361289,I have tried it twice unsuccessfully. What I refer to as the exhale vent that provides a breathing balance is inadequate. Possibly a change in the location to near the nasal component versus at the hose connection and an increase in the exhale vent(s) would make it functional. Will try a couple more times but most likely return it.,3

20,553,1464148811,"Compared to my Swift FX that I replaced, the DreamWear nasal mask is far more comfortable and produces much less noise as it's a much better seal. Placing the air hose on top of the head gets it out of the way versus literally hanging off your nose with the Swift FX design.",3

I have been using the Wisp for about 18 months and do well with it except for the red spot on the bridge of my nose. I already figured out to run my hose over the head top of my head for best mobility and no air blowing in my eyes. So when I saw the DreamWear, I was smitten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mask is very easy to fit with the included measuring template. Despite having what I think is a large melon, the medium frame and medium cushion fit well. It is so comfortable to wear! It feels soft under my nose, like it's barely there. On my back, it worked great. No leaks, good effect even at my relatively high pressure of 14-15.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem for me came when I tried to roll onto my side.  Then the seal was broken and leaks started. Also, if I move any part of my face in the least, even while on my back, leak city.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave it a week because it was so comfortable.

It's comfortable , non-confining and, amazingly has reduced my leak charts to the lowest I've ever seen! And so easy to slip off and back on when needed during the night.

20,571,1462982958,"Well, the DreamWear mask is comfortable  - I'll give it that.  The mask and the pillow are so soft, you can hardly feel it on your face.  If you can only figure out a way to keep the nasal pillow under your nose, you'll have a winner!   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillow has no nasal inserts - only a slit that is supposed to stay under your nostrils.  And there is only one strap adjustment on the mask, which makes it hard to fit to the contours of your head.  I tried two different pillow sizes and several different strap tightnesses, and I could never get that thing to stay on my nose all night unless I tightened the strap to the point where the pressure under my nose actually hurt.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI'm disappointed, because the concept really seemed like a good idea from a comfort perspective.  I just could never get it to stay put.  CPAP masks are always a compromise between comfort and fit.  Many that fit securely where they below are so uncomfortable you don't want to wear them.  This one goes too far in the opposite extreme.  So I'm still looking for that perfect compromise.",8

I can feel it there and it bothers me.  It took a bit getting use to with the mask fit but doable.  What I don't like and doesn't work well for me is when sleeping on my side i get a lot of leakage. Amd them the air blows and blows hard I can not get s proper seal. I tired tighten the mask, sleeping less on and angle and still had the issue.

It was very comfortable, it fits very loosly on your head and just barely touches the bottom of your nose, but still seals very well -there was no discernable leaking. I was impressed by the fit. I also liked the way the tube routes from on top of the head. With the air fit you end up snuggling with the tube all night (OK if you have a fleece hose cozy), but with this mask the hose is well out of the way, pretty great! \\r\\n\\r\\nThey route the air down both sides of your face in parallel channels so that you can crush one with your cheek and still get good airflow.

It is definitely worth trying out.",2

I do find I need a chinstrap with it, which isn't a big deal to me, but may be for others.  I like that the hose attaches on top of my head, as it stays out of my way and bugs me MUCH less than the standard ""in yer face"" connection.  It's light and comfortable, I can see around it to read, and getting a drink of water no longer a major disruption to my sleep!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, there are a couple of quirky things about it.  The first is just funny:  because the hose attaches where it does, be prepared to look like a Snork.  Combined with the ""mutton chop"" look of the mask itself, and a chin strap thrown in besides, the effect is somewhere between amusing and ridiculous.  So hey, free entertainment for yourself and others!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second is something I genuinely consider a flaw in the otherwise excellent design.  One of the mask's two exhalation ports is located on the very front of the mask, just below the nose, pointing straight out from the face.  My machine runs at 9 cm H20, and the stream of air from it is easily detectable for a good 10~12 inches from my face.  This does not amuse my wife.  I basically crocheted a ""bra"" for the front of the mask to diffuse the air stream, but that's not something everyone would be able to do readily, and it's a rather crude solution.  I hope that the manufacturer quickly figures out that a slightly more elegant one is in order to address this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, that is the one and only negative I've found so far with this mask.  Otherwise, it's an excellent product that functions elegantly.  I already plan to buy it again when the time comes to replace this one, hopefully by that time I won't have to resort to handicrafts.",1

20,649,1459367271,"I've been wearing a CPAP mask for over 20 years.  I've tried every different type as they became available, but always returned to the Respironics Profile Lite Gel, my favourite since it came out.  But, while it worked for me, it was too close to my eyes, and over the years large bags developed under them.  I almost didn't try the Dreamwear because all the other cushion types had not worked for me.  I decided to give it a go because of the free return insurance.  I am so, so glad I did.  Finally, a mask that works for me and is away from my eyes.  I really cannot see why it works so well as compared to all the other cushion types that I've tried, but it does.  It's light, comfortable, and quiet.  The only down side is that suddenly I'm dreaming again, something I have not done in 20 years, and could live without.  I have a large hat size but the medium frame fits me perfectly.  The gauge suggested that I should use the small cushion, so I did at first.  I later decided to try the medium cushion and found that it works even better.  With it I can be on my side when going to sleep, something that didn't quite work properly with the smaller size for some reason.  I am a restless sleeper and yet this mask does not move at all during the night.  This mask is perfect for me, but there's no mask that will suit everyone, so I suggest that anyone trying to find a better mask for themselves should give the Dreamwear a try, and experiment with the different cushions and frame positioning.  I was skeptical before I bought it, but now, after 20 years of looking, I've finally found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.",2

This mask is comfortable and provides a great seal with my nose.  Most welcome is the connection point of the tube from the CPAP.  Since it sets at the top of the head instead of hanging from the front of the mask I've not yet had any trouble with it pulling the mask out of position, not matter how much I turn, toss or twist.  This is by far and away the best mask I've ever used over the last 12 + years.",1
20,658,1459265049,"Like it very much. Extremely comfortable. Much less likely to have to readjust during the night.  However, it is significantly noisier.  Just had to decide it is my private noise machine.",0
20,659,1459262352,"Best CPAP device I've used.  Easy to seal off leaks, very comfortable, light weight and much less obtrusive than those I've previously used.",1
20,660,1459257186,"Very comfortable, maybe the most comfortable mask I have ever worn. No obstruction of sight. Only thing that keeps this mask from being 5 stars is that when laying on your side, the mask becomes very loud to the wearer.",1
20,661,1459107202,"No matter how much I adjust everything on this mask, I cannot get a good fit that doesn't leak excessively and irritate my eyes by morning.  I've read and reread the instructions and thought I was good to go. It has a good fit when first put on, but moves around and loses that seal as soon as I lay my head on the pillow and I end up waking throughout the night fidgeting and adjusting it multiple times.  The overall reviews were what convinced me to try this mask and I really wanted to like it.  I will be returning it for a style I've used in the past.",1
20,662,1459018937,"When opening the package for this mask, I was struck by the wonder of such an intriguing concept.  I fit it, I put it on, and WOW, I was struck by how SOFT the nosepiece was, how comfortable it was around the cheeks.  The head strap tugged on my hair a little, but it was manageable.  I was actually super excited to try this mask out that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI barely slept the first night.  The mask was noisy and leaky.  This is expected adjustment time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI barely slept the second night.  The mask was noisy and leaky.  This is expected adjustment time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the third night, with zero improvement in comfort and reliability, I was so sleep deprived I nearly discarded the mask in frustration.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo combination of nosepieces and headgear\\/strap fitment would give me the ability to sleep without leaks and extremely noisy hissing.  My face would twitch, or I would yawn, and PIFFFFFFF, air everywhere.  Back sleeping was the least offensive of all of them, but after a time, the slightly tacky back of the head straps would cause soreness due to yanking on my hair with every move, and would slowly creep up my head, eventually leaving the mask loose and leaky.\\r\\n\\r\\nFine, I said, the headgear is probably too small.  I LIKE the feel of this mask, so I wanted to make it work.  I ordered the Large headgear from CPAP.COM, deciding to eat the $30 because I was sure I could make this work.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn't.  The initial problems remained, save that the Large headgear was clearly far too big for me.  After another full week of different combinations and growing increasingly more cranky, unfocused, and sleep deprived, I went back to my old mask.  I'm honestly angry at this mask because the fitment options are vast, but it just WOULD NOT WORK.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros:\\r\\nLight\\r\\nComfortable when first put on\\r\\nLots of nasal cushion size options\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\nNoisy\\r\\nPulls on hair\\r\\nHeadgear fitment is difficult\\r\\nSeals poorly\\r\\n\\r\\nThank goodness for return insurance.  Good luck with this one, folks. :P",2
20,663,1459013617,Excellent mask for me. Replaced my ResMed Ultra Mirage II mask. I sleep better with the DreamWear mask since it is more comfortable and permits more side sleeping movement.,1

So, I went with this as a possible next step -- especially liked the idea of the hose being able to go over my head so I didn't have to ""cozy up"" with it at night.  But, eventually this went the way of the nasal pillows.  I never felt it was sitting where it was supposed to -- it's not supposed to go in your nose, but right under it; maybe it did, but I was anxious about it.  Also noisy. And I felt a lot of air was escaping, too.",2

When I was buying my new CPAP machine, I came across this mask.  It did take me about 3 days to get used to it because my old mask was like a security blanket - I couldn't go to sleep without it.  This mask is so small and unobtrusive that it felt like I was not wearing a mask at all.  I used to fuss with the straps on my Gel mask constantly, and I have had very few leaks with the Dreamwear mask.  I also love that I can see!  Nothing is obstructing my line of vision.  In addition, the hose comes off the top of your head, so you don't have to worry about it getting wrapped around your neck when you roll over.  There are two streams of air from the vents that come out at the top of your head and out of the nasal piece.  If your pillow case gets in the wrong position, it sounds like you have a leak, but I am sure that I will be able to accommodate this as I become more used to the new mask.  Another benefit is that I can snuggle with my boyfriend without jabbing him with a hard mask.",1

20,678,1458405304,I just received this mask and have only worn it one night.  It appears as though this will replace my long time trusted gel lite mask.  I had problems with either fit or comfort with every nasal mask I tried.  The gel lite and other similar masks worked great.  The only down side was pressure below my nose and some irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tried nasal pillows and a small nasal mask but the tended to leak.  I am at 10 psi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mask works just fine - so far.  It is more comfortable than my gel lite and works well.  No leaking and no problems with fit as I move around.  I would give it 5 stars if I was sure my experience will remain the same.,1

20,683,1458221651,"The DreamWear Nasal CPAP mask is the very best mask I have ever tried. All the others have multiple issues to deal with. The DreamWear mask is perfect for many reasons. It's very lightweight, quiet, and its airflow doesn't ""bounce off"" the pillow and disturb the user. The airflow doesn't irritate one's nostrils and most importantly one doesn't have to manually move the attached airhose when turning in bed. The hose is attached to the mask's frame at the top of the head and therefore follows you as you move during sleep. Finally, if you sleep on your side during the night, no problem. The mask's air pressure supply has dual input sources - one on each side of the face. If sleeping on your side closes one of the supply sources, the other source continues to deliver the air pressure required to keep you in your therapeudic range. \\r\\nAfter the first week of use I have only good things to say about this mask. The only thing that might be better would be to not have sleep apnea and therefore not need the CPAP treatment!",10
20,684,1458150893,This product is the best of several masks and nasal prongs that I have tried. It allows me to sleep on either side without disrupting the seal. Eliminated the pressure on the bridge of my nose. Very nice design.,4

20,687,1458077615,"This is an improvement but still far from completely comfortable or convenient.  A  major improvement for side or stomach sleepers as I am. This mask has eliminated the horrible face imprints that you get with the other masks.  But still wishing for, waiting for, a small nasal attachment that will suffice for the syndrome.  Overall I would give it a 3 out of 5 where I would've given the full nasal mask a 2 out of 5.",2

It uses exhaust ports on both the top of the head gear and at the nasal section to drastically cut down on that annoying jet stream that can blow your partner out of bed.  It could be improved by adding a smaller hose to connect to the CPAP hose.  Connecting directly is a little bulky.  I haven't pulled my stats out of the machine yet to determine if I am getting as good or better night's sleep, but I wake up feeling rested.",3

20,698,1457790437,"Ever since my favorite nasal pillow mask was discontinued, I've been looking for a comfortable replacement. This one has worked well so far. It is light, comfortable, reasonably quiet, and I like the fact that the hose connects at the top. I've been having fairly good sleep with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does take a little getting used though. The nasal pillows aren't the type that fit into each nostril. It is actually a large slit that nestles across both nostrils and seals pretty well from the air pressure. Air flow is very good even during ramp up. I was a little surprised at how good the air flow is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe headgear does have a tendency to slip up over the hair on the back of your head as you move around at night. You just have to keep working at the adjustment until it fits with minimal slippage. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that is odd is that the air flows through the frame on either side of your cheek. As you roll over on your side, the air flow on the pillow side of your head will stop as the frame compresses from the weight of your head. So all of a sudden, the nostril on the pillow side of your nose will experience much lower air flow for a short time until things compensate. I find that to be a little annoying and it has awakened me on several occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I like the mask so far. Is it for everyone? Probably not. Is it better than the other ones I have? Yes. Is it the perfect mask for me? No. New masks come out all the time, but right now, this one is good enough to keep.",6

I am used to leakage on my previous mask, but I am usually able to adjust and fix it pretty quick.  This mask has proven difficult to pinpoint the problem.  If I tighten the straps, the leakage stops, but my nose hurts.  Going to keep trying to figure out the right balance, but I may end up using the return insurance I got with it.",3

20,704,1457445950,"Before ordering this mask I read the reviews and had some trepidation because of the comments relating to the air flow and leakage.  I was particularly interested in the new mask's less imposing facial design especially because the nasal mask I had been using left red marks on my face in the morning around its perimeter and even more importantly, the air flow leakage was causing dry eye and dryness around the sensitive skin around my eyes.   I read the detailed instructions on fitting the new mask and found that by following them completely, the mask fits well and the air leakage is mitigated.  I do find the mask requires a bit more attention and tweaking but I have done so and adapted to it very quickly.  I would give it five stars except for the little more attention to fit necessary.  I find it so much more comfortable and am sleeping better with the less imposing facial mask.  My skin looks better in the morning with no marks and the dryness in the eyes and the skin area around them is already improved.

Better but made my nostrils very sore and I returned it. Next, I tried the SleepWeaver. I thought I found the perfect mask. Comfortable, quiet, but it leaked like crazy and I could not prevent it. I am now using a DreamWear and its the best for me so far with a few things keeping it from being perfect, the main one being the head straps routinely slip off and I have to re-fit it several times a night. It's also a bit noisy especially when you sleep on your side. Medium seems a bit loose for me and difficult to adjust. I would like to try a small but unsure cpap.com carries different sizes. I found cpap.com's service first rate.",3
20,729,1455572514,"I've tried many masks from both Repironics and Resmed.  Pillows, Full face, and Nasal masks.  None were as effective as this mask.  I liked the Resmed nasal pillows, so I was skeptical about ordering this mask.  I am now glad that I did order this mask, and the results have been amzing for me.  The leaks are almost eliminated, my AHI is the lowest with this mask, pressure readings from Sleepy Head software are very consistent, and it is the most comfortable mask I've had yet.  The overhead tube is ingenious for an active sleeper like me, and I thought it was going to worse before I tried it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI still love the Resmed pillows, but this product has it beat.  Kudos to the design team at Respironics.  This proves to me that you have to be open minded about occasionally trying new masks.",7

20,731,1455380839,"This is at least 1000% more comfortable than the old pillow mask.  It does everything claimed for it.  No more check abrasions, no more fussing with the straps and fitting.  Someone should have thought of this years ago.",6
20,732,1455296426,"I am a long time CPAP user.  This is the most comfortable mask that I have ever worn.  I have used full face, nasal, and pillows masks.  This one is like a pillows mask, but without the discomfort of the pillows inside my nostrils, which prevented me from using pillows in the past.  I always get indentations with the full face and nasal mask around my nose and mouth, which was embarrassing for me during the day.  This mask leaves no indentations so far (I've only used it for a week) and is the most comfortable mask I have ever worn.  However, I think I need a large frame, so will be returning and re-ordering.",7
20,733,1455243520,"Very nice, no more tickling nose pillows. Which I must say where not horrid, but every-so-often irritating. This mask removes them, and surprising maintains the airflow. Awesome, thank you DreamWear!",6
20,734,1455207696,"Plus: Very comfortable, can sleep easily sleep on my side because of design. Hose is out of the way, mask itself is soft against my face. Seal against nostrils is surprisingly good. Minus: Took a while to get strap tightness adjusted so that it didn't leak. When it leaks the air goes almost directly into my eyes.",6
20,735,1455200622,Simply amazing.  Almost like wearing nothing at all.,1

20,737,1455137506,"This was a total surprise. I had given up hope that I could ever sleep comfortably again.  This mask feels as close to ""no mask"" as I could possibly imagine and no longer makes me feel like I am attached to a hose and machine.  Thank you.",8

20,742,1455027357,I've been using my nasal pillow mask for years and was generally happy with that. But the dreamwear mask is even better - very comfortable and makes a nice seal easily.  I'd definitely recommend it to others.,3

I've primarily used the Mirage Swift II, which is a great mask, too, but I now prefer the DreamWear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing I love is that no more mask lines on my face, no irritation in nostrils from pillows, and no hose coming off one side. The DW mask has the hose coming off the top, so you can move pretty freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend it!",3

20,745,1454893578,Everything advertised in the ad arrived at my door as it was intended.  I cannot get this device to maintain a decent seal through the night.  I tried it for several nights.  I was woken up with the airflow noise from a bad seal.  This caused me to lose sleep and generally make me feel miserable.  I tried all of the included nose sizes included in the package.  Nothing helped.  I adjusted it many ways to try to get the mask to work for me.  I wish to return it.,8
20,746,1454857040,"I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago.  I have trialed several masks.  I am a restless sleeper.  Constantly moving.  Masks would slip and move, or be so tight that I would wake up with pain and irritation from the pressure.  This mask is the BEST one I have tried.  It is not pushing something up my nose, it is not leaving marks on my face.  It is lightweight, but stays in place.  Thank you, thank you, thank you to whomever came up with this mask.",6
20,747,1454806462,"I stumbled onto the Dreamware Nasal Mask quite by accident, but I am sure glad that I did.  When it arrived, I took it out of the box, attached the appropriate sized cushion, and have used it every night since.  I have found it to be very comfortable and delivers plenty of air although I had read reviews to the contrary.  My wife says that it is very quiet.\\r\\nI enjoyed my old nose pillow mask for 15 years, but I've moved on.",4
20,748,1454786879,"I have been using a c-pap unit for twenty years, and have. worn many types of masks. But the dream ware mask is the most comfortable mask that I have worn.Its easy to put on and take off. There are no clips or fasteners to conted with. Just pull it on. Plus I have no pressure point's on my face. This is the best mask yet 'for me.(",2
20,749,1454677746,"It does not leave any marks and works great!  It does make a mark under my nose as if it is almost a little too small.  There is no adjusting except for the back strap but, I love that I have NO face lines!!",4
20,750,1454650793,I really liked the idea of this product but the mask did not maintain a seal throughout the night. In the morning I had a dry throat and felt tired on the 4 nights I tried the product. Also the airflow was louder than the air pillow masks that I like and have used for the last 4 years. The product may work for you depending on how well it fits you and your sleep habits.,3
20,751,1454625492,"I don't usually provide reviews but this product was so superior, I though I should share the information.\\r\\nI am a side sleeper and have used the Activia mask for several years.  Although it worked better than anything I have used previously, it could not compare to the DreamWear.  Its nice that I can use my glasses while wearing it and it took no time to adjust to this technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo the test will be how long it last and ease of cleaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far...Great product",5
20,752,1454618421,"I really like this mask. It is not invasive. It rests under my nose, not in it. I'm surprised that it maintains the seal that it does. With the connector on the top of the head, the airflow and related noise is moved away from the face. I am a side sleeper, and I have very little air leakage. I have tried several masks, and this is by far my favorite.",3

I use the included strap wraps and am blissfully free of marks in the morning.  The mask is comfortable and stays put. I'm now sleeping through the night.",0
20,756,1454534490,"There are advantages to this mask for sure. but there are disadvantages as well.  It is lightweight, and less cumbersome than the wisp as well as quieter. Sadly I find the headgear is too loose causing it to slips around I rarely get a proper seal and have resorted to sewing it myself trying to tighten it.  It is not easy to have to wear a CPAP and to be fighting with it at night makes it even more difficult.",6
20,757,1454525367,This nasal mask is very comfortable. Much better than the half mask I  was using.,3
20,758,1454516200,I like this product much better than my previous mask product as I can lay on my side and it doesn't cause an airflow gap like would occur with the mask.  It is also much lighted and doesn't leave marks on my face in the morning (and I haven't used the accessory to help with the face marks).  I also like the fact that it results in an open field of vision.,5
20,759,1454449285,This mask is more comfortablee than the pillows I've been using.  The best part is there is no forehead piece and the hose is connected at the top of your head.  It's completely out of the way and there is no sense of the presense of a hose.  My favorite mask thus far after 8 years of CPAP use.,19
20,760,1454434088,"This mask is probably great for some people.  I've tried nasal pillows and they were painful.  This mask is comfortable but it always feels like it is falling off, since I started using it, I have been waking up a few times per night and readjusting.  I've used the sizing guide and even tried different sizes just to make sure but for me, it isn't a good mask.  I'm going back to my over the nose mask.",14

20,764,1454424696,"With out a doubt the mask design is very comfortable,  and light weight... However, the disadvantage for me is the noise. The mask air inlet is located on the top, so it pushes the air along each side chamber, which is very close to your ears. Unfortunately, I could hear the air coming into the cushion and I could hear my self exhaling as well. Noise may not be an issue to others, but for me I meant waking up several times at night. Hope this helps you make an informed decision.",30
20,765,1454423055,"I love my new DreamWear Nasal mask. It's by far the most comfortable mask I've ever had, and I've been on CPAPs for about 15 years.  I've always wished I could do nasal pillows, but I can't stand having things stuck up my nose.  Consequently I've had to settle for the more traditional nasal masks, which have always felt very clunky and awkward, not to mention having the problem of occasionally leaking air into my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new style of mask has none of those issues.  Since it connects at the top of your head instead of at your face, the incoming hose is safely tucked above your head.  The only thing on your face is the very small, soft tube that sits just under your nose (NOT IN IT!), and is almost negligible in its presence. It's really almost like I'm not wearing a mask at all!\\r\\n\\r\\nI went with the ""fit kit"" so I could try out the different sizes. Turns out I would have been fine just using their sizing template and ordering the size it recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said - definitely the best mask I've ever used.  Wish I'd had it sooner!",20
20,766,1454355592,Excellent mask!  Comfy and minimal leakage.  My new favorite,5
20,767,1454271278,Mask is noisier in general (air moving through tubes in front of the ears) than Swift LT. Leaks more when I lay on my side. Nasal pillows have rubbed a sore spot under my nose every night I have used this mask. Do like the system for attaching the hose.,14
20,768,1454247225,Can't sleep on My sides without loses mask control and leakage increases dramaically,20
20,769,1454178267,So far I have tried a full mask and nose pillows and by far the Dream Wear is the best for me.  The swivel on top keeps me from tangling in the hose. Rarely do I get the blast of cool air in the eyes.  The only improvement in this product would be some sort of spreader going from the top of head the gear to the back strap. This would keep the back strap from creeping up.,5
20,770,1454176085,"The pros of this mask are:\\r\\nThe air vent design is excellent, it keeps the blowing air where it doesn't bother you\\r\\nIt's very soft, comfortable, lightweight, minimal\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cons:\\r\\nIt's noisy. You can hear the air rushing around your nose and also up the sides of the mask. The sound reverberated through my pillow and filled my ears with the sound of rushing air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way the mask channels air to the nose caused a cooling sensation and the end of my nose got quite cold. This was very uncomfortable to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mask frame must fit your head as it is, there is no adjustment on the height of the frame, only the back strap is adjustable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary:\\r\\nI wanted to love this mask but unfortunately the cons made it impossible for me to wear it long. I could not get a good enough seal with the smallest cushion to prevent leakage around the end of my nose (it was too wide). The affect of rushing air at the end of my nose made my nose cold and the noise kept me awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked my husband to try the mask and see what he thought of it. He got a good fit but the noise also bothered him, he preferred his P10.",12

Also, I had not realized the effort required to exhale with other masks until trying this one which eliminates the effort.  I can truly relax & sleep.  In addition, there are no indented strap lines on my face in the morning.  It is well worth the cost!!!",5

20,777,1454033011,"At first I wasn't sure if this mask was going to work. I have very petite features. (I have problems getting a ballcap that is small enough to fit me.) I bought the fit pack and a small frame to make sure to get the right fit. I think I'm somewhere in the middle of a small and a medium frame--the small tends to want to creep forward and come off my head--the medium seemed floppy and wanted to shift also. So the trick for me (which is fine by me) is to fish my long hair through the headstrap, and just use the medium frame with the small cushion. I love the hose connector being on top. I am an active sleeper so I appreciate the swivel connector so I don't get tangled in hoses or have the mask pulled off.  On the other hand, the quick release is kind of useless as I always manage to accidentally clip my hair into the connector. The mask is so easy to put on and take off that I don't use the quick release anyway. Despite those minor issues I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mask. It is comfortable, light weight, and doesn't leave marks.",4

One of my favorite masks (which is no longer made) had the hose connect over the head, keeping it away from shoulders and arms when tossing and turning, which this one does  The design of the airflow down the cheek straps seemed ingenious.  Now to the bad design.  The silicone piece that delivers the air to the nostrils is flat with a singular cut out triangle for air to both nostrils.  It does not seal well at all no matter what size I used. If they simply used a nasal pillow design into each nostril, this would be 5 stars.  I had to return it, not understanding how this design works for anyone.",5
20,813,1453554622,"I have  used a CPAP for almost 13 years and always used a Resmed nasal mask. It is a good mask but I have begun to have some issues with the straps and forehead pad causing skin problems, air in my eyes causing chronic dry eyes, and the imprint causing eye bags and a mustache line. I have tried several alternatives and could not adjust and went back to the nasal model. I decided to try the Dream Wear product when I was having skin treatments that caused much pain on my forehead and temples from the nasal mask. It had different pressure but was an easy adjustment only taking about 2 nights. It does not hurt my nose and was very easy to fit. I have used it for a week and my eyes are better, my skin is better and I have no more mustache line. The eye bags are much reduced. I would highly recommend this mask for the serious CPAPers who need a less face touching mask. One note is that the air flows though the sides to the nose pillow and are hindered if I move to my side to sleep so this may not be the choice for folk who cannot back sleep.",3

The mask is much less restricted than my old mask.  The air discharge port is a bit louder than my old mask but not enough to bother me getting to sleep.  I am very happy so far with the mask.",3
20,816,1453502704,"The head gear fits well but is very loud, the air moving through it and coming out of the holes in the top and front of the nose , very cold.",4
20,817,1453497352,If you try this mask you'll never go back ... at least that's my opinion.   My wife also uses CPAP and until we tried this mask for her she was never able to sleep the night through.\\r\\nWe now have 5 of them for here and travel.,4
20,818,1453490306,"Using this product for 3 days now and it seems to be working very well, even from the start in terms of getting used to the under nose style of cushion. This is my 3 rd nasal cushion style mask. Purchased the wisp in the past for travel, and it works well too. This one probably even better in terms of small size and no leaking.  The fixed hose mount on top of the head seems to stay in place best of all  That attachment on the wisp is the main negative. The dream wear is a much less cumbersome apparatus and I was surprised that the direct contact under my nose really didn't bother me. I haven't tried the cushion type where the pillows fit into the nostrils, but know I wouldn't like that one- also less sanitary etc. The head gear also seems to stay in place very well even with some turning of the head. Cons- The little ancillary strap for the back of the head is terribly cheap and lightly constructed. I really doesn't contribute much to the stability , so it may not be necessary at all. I would suggest improving it or removing it. Causes one to question the overall quality of the thing. Dumb!!",4

He LOVES this one.  So do I.  They seem to float on your face.  They don't look terribly secure but they stay in place quite well.  We are both restless sleepers, so this was a trial by fire.  Highly recommended.  This will be our mask of choice from now on.",2

Was a little reluctant to but this due to the nasal pillow design, but so far it works and is less intrusive than the insert type.  Need to give it a few more nights to see if I can get the straps adjusted to my head, but so far I like it.",1

20,829,1453386505,"I tried this mask because of the design in having the connection hose at the crown of your head.  The mask itself was the problem very leaky no matter what size or adjustments.  It was comfortable to wear until air was applied, then it did not seal and was very noisy.  I was very disappointed with the results, I really wanted it to work.",4

As a petite woman and side-sleeper, the medium frame with a small nasal cushion fits well, is extremely comfortable, keeps a very good seal in different positions, and leaves little to no facial marks!   I slept surprisingly well on the very first night and am so grateful to have the DreamWear Nasal Mask!  I highly recommend it!",8
20,833,1453292529,"It leaked air like a sieve, kept me awake, and the manufacturers (you guys) seem to focus entirely on coming up with a nose-piece that fits UNDER the nose, rather than AROUND it.  Why?  IT DOESN'T WORK.  In your perfect world, I'd never move...lying perfectly stationary, face up, breathing gently.  In the real world, people move their heads during sleep.  With YOUR ""nose-piece""...that means Waking UP...constantly.",7
20,834,1453209865,"This is the most unobtrusive, comfortable nasal mask I have ever worn. Slept through the night on the first try. Better than a cloth nasal mask....which is also pretty good, but DreamWear is better with its clever airflow design. Easy to clean. I am very satisfied.",2

Unfortunately I began getting another sore after a few nights.    \\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know if my situation is unique or not, but I can honestly say if it wasn't for my experience getting the sores I would give this mask a 5 star rating.  Unfortunately I have reverted back to my old mask.",2

20,839,1452828254,"Overall the best mask I have used so far.  Minimal contact and low profile are great descriptions for this one.  No leaks from day one.  My only criticism is that you can hear the air flow through the tubes during inhale.  I can't imagine anything better, but until then, this is the one I will use.  With return insurance included, I see no reason not try this one.",2
20,840,1452799209,"This mask is awesome. I am a new to CPAP and am thankful this mask was available from the beginning. I have tried a wisp and the nasal pillows. Couldn't get it together with the wisp, felt too restricted in my ability to move about the bed. The nasal pillows were ok and I could have lived with those, but the nostril irritation was a little annoying, and there was still that need to adjust the hose every time I moved. I finally broke down and bought DreamWear and will never buy another mask (unless I have to of course). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe placement of the hose eliminates the need for me to move it out of the way and rearrange it every time I toss or turn at night. The way the mask sits against my nostrils rather than in them completely eliminates the nostril pain. It is comfortable and I am finally getting more restful sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome have complained about the sound of the air. Doesn't bother me at all. I don't hear anything coming out of the side of the mask. The exhaust comes out of the nose rest and the point where the hose attaches. The only time I hear it is when I lay sideways on my pillow and the air is blowing onto the pillow. At first I thought it meant leak, but it wasn't and a slight rearranging of my face takes care of the ""white noise"". I cannot recommend this mask enough and will never be without it as long as I am a hose head. Buy it.",18
20,841,1452608833,This is the only mask so far that is conformable.  It doesn't hurt at all and the seal is great.  Only thing I dont like is how the tube connection is on the top of the head.,3

I tried each of the cushions and adjusting the head gear. I just couldn't make it work. Very disappointed, because it felt great. If they had another head strap a little lower I think it would have worked.",3

However, it does for the most part, just if it had the same soft nasal pillows you would feel that it couldn't leak and I believe that it would make this product the most perfect product to buy of any of them. I still give it 5 stars and say try it.",1
20,845,1452024740,"This is a great mask....the best that I have had yet!!  It is light, comfortable and the hose attaches at the top of your head making it much easier to move in your sleep without waking up.  I have no red marks when I wake up as there are few straps actually touching your face and the mask itself fits comfortable under your nose without the suffocating feel of the masks that actually plug into the nostrils.

I have worn all kinds, mostly full face and this one leaks a lot less and is far more comfortable. Recommend highly.",13

It's nice not to worry about the hose breaking the seal on the mask  because I moved. More importantly, it comes off and goes on easily.",3
20,858,1450562185,DreamWear Nasal is the best mask yet. The fact that the nose piece goes under the nose and not in it makes for a very comfortable and effective mask. I bought two so that if anything goes wrong I will not have to revert to other kinds of masks I have on hand.,3
20,859,1450448420,I decided to try this new mask because it was risk free. I could always return it if I didn't like it. Now I love it. Very comfortable. I used to wear nasal pillows. This mask is more comfortable and stays put all night. I'll never go back.,2
20,860,1450358560,Love this mask. Slim design yet efficient.,1
20,861,1450316408,After trying a few masks and a purely nasal pillow this is by far the most comfortable mask I've found. As a man with a beard it's hard to get a good seal with other masks but with this one I had no problem. Highly recommended.,6

20,864,1450220500,I participated in the trial review for this ask and was sorry to see the trial end. The mask is extremely comfortable to wear. If you are an active sleeper like me you will find very little movement in the mask and little or no leakage. The covers on the straps leave little or no strap marks on your face after a full nights sleep.,2
20,865,1450212352,This new mask works great! This is my fourth mask in five\\r\\nyears and it is the best so far. It is a lot more comfortable\\r\\nthan the nasal pillow.

20,866,1449933089,I would like it better if it wasnt attached on top of the head i think really makes it too heavy .,2
20,867,1449874407,Have used for about 3 weeks and am very impressed. One of the best designs I have encountered. Did required change of setting from pillows to mask to have correct air flow. Seals much quicker than my nasal pillow mask. Thanks,2
20,868,1449760735,I have had 10 different masks and this by far is the nicest one I have used!,1
20,869,1449683909,"Okay, I will start by saying that I have only recently been formally diagnosed and placed on a CPAP machine.  I was previously fitted with an F10 from ResMed, which is a great mask. I am and active sleeper though and kept being awaken by air leaks around the mask.  So, with that issue at hand, I started looking and subsequently found this mask.  I have only been on it for a week and my leaks went to zero (according to the machine and my experience) and my events have gone down from an average of 3.5 to 1.5 per hour.  I only wake up once during the night (for some reason at around 3:30 AM) but that has been the case on or off CPAP.  I do not need to strap this mask down tight to achieve a great seal which means that I get to sleep faster. As and active sleeper, I always had to restle with my hose.  Not with this mask!!! As I flip from side to side or on my back, the hose is not a concern anymore.  As a side note, I have back issues and that is what keeps me tossing around.  I highly recommend this mask whether you are and active sleeper or not based on my limited experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n",8
20,870,1449669567,better than previos mask,1
20,871,1449628174,"I have only been using a CPAP machine for the past 6 months. I started with the Mirage FX Nasal CPAP mask. For a newbie to this all It took quite a bit of getting used to. I found that I had to incline my head backwards often to get the mask to seat well when sleeping on my back. I was never able to get this mask to work while on my side. I found that the cushions were only good for a little over a month. I also started to get tender areas at the top of the nose and where the straps went close to the top of the ears. I have been using the DreamWear now for 3 weeks. I find it a huge improvement. The mask is very light and comfortable. Their sizing chart works fine. The unique under the nose cushion seats well when you get the right size. The outflow is directed away from the face and doesn\\u2019t interfere with sleep. While I don\\u2019t sleep on my side for more that a few hours, this mask makes that possible. I find the design remarkable and the hose attachment at the top of the head is much better than coming from the front of the mask. I have just ordered replacement cushions but don\\u2019t know the life of them as yet. They look a bit longer lasting than the Mirage cushions but time will tell. Regardless of the life of the cushions I think that this mask is a winner since I sleep better with it!",5
20,872,1449505957,"I'm rather new to CPAP use, but after 2 lab studies, and talking with my technicians, I learned that finding the right mask is worth the time and effort.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCPAP is no fun, but of the four masks I've tried, I like the DreamWear best. It doesn't give me the claustrophobic sensation I had wearing a full-face mask; and it hasn't abraded the skin around my nose or caused pimples, which are problems I experienced with a traditional nasal mask. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the DreamWear mask, I also wear a chin strap to encourage me to keep my mouth closed during sleep. An open mouth creates a huge air leak, which defeats the delivery of positive air pressure and causes a dry throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFYI-- Before DreamWear, I tried two full-face masks: ""Amara"" by Respironics, and ""Simplus"" by Fisher & Paykel; and a nasal pillow mask called ""Eson"" made by Fisher & Paykel.",5
20,873,1449339534,"Good seal, no facial marks in morning, comfortable. This is a winner!",1
20,874,1449266065,This mask is great!  I can turn side to side without hard plastic digging into my face.  Also no marks on the bridge of my nose as with previous masks.,4
20,875,1449198598,"I have been using CPAP for almost 15 years and, during that time, have only come across a few masks that tolerable.  Based on its reviews and unique design, I decided to try the DreamWear Nasal Mask.  It was strange not having a mask covering up my face or pillows up my nostrils.  As a matter of fact, it was and still is quite comfortable.  Although the measuring template shows me to be a medium, I find that both the small and medium cushions work quite well (haven't tried the large yet).  The only problem I have with this mask is, on occasion, the headgear straps will slide upward over the back of my head and the mask will fall off during the night.  Maybe this is occurring because I don't have it adjusted properly.  Overall, I am very pleased with not only the comfort, but the ability to seal completely to avoid leaks.  I hope to be using this mask for a long time to come.",7
20,876,1449150789,"I've used a CPAP for 6 years. I switched from a full mask to the ResMed Swift FX nose pillow mask within a couple weeks.  Now, I've switched to the DreamWear nasal mask and really like it. Best advantages for me is the light pressure on your face and the ability to roll over without losing the fit. The only negative is the noise of the air flow is louder than the Swift - something you get used to within a few nights!  Great product!  I'd recommend it!",3
20,877,1449062995,OK- this thing is really great- a huge step in the right direction for those of us who have difficulty tolerating ANY mask\\/pillows that we've tried. First night I was able to sleep about 7 hrs. This is big- because for the past year- I have not been able to tolerate ANY mask\\/pillows I've tried for more than 3 - 5hrs max. Two nights ago I was able to use this mask for almost 8 hrs--again-- this is a huge improvement over anything else out these-- and I've tried them all. NB: because of the design- this mask makes a little more airflow noise than some of the others- as if to suggest that it might be leaking. Since I've started using it- my AirCurve has reported no leaks and has indicated that mask fit is good + a smiley face. So that little extra whooshing sound is simply a characteristic of this mask and does not indicate a leak or 'malfunction.' Using this mask so successfully from day 1 just reinforces the crucial role that the mask plays in CPAP therapy and how a great fitting mask will contribute to the overall success of using CPAP. I'm really impressed by this design and designs such as this should only evolve and get better in the future. I'm taking a trip to Asia soon and very happy that I'll have this mask to use on the plane: it will be much less of a spectacle than a full face mask and will be more compact than other masks. This one's a keeper.,7
20,878,1449017927,"I expected more base on the rave reviews, but don't find it an improvement over my prior SwiftFX nasal pillow, which I really like. So, I am comparing the DreamWear to the already excellent SwiftFX, and am undecided as to which I prefer, but am leaning on returning to the SwiftFX. A few more nights will tell...",2
20,879,1448906808,"Unfortunately for me, the mask did not work but it had many nice features. Pros: very light mask, easy to assemble and reassemble, easy to clean, hose attachment is on the head is out of the way, didn't leak for me, and vents not noisy. \\r\\nCons: I am a side sleeper and very sensitive to straps across my cheeks and temples. So, sadly, the mask straps were uncomfortable. Really really liked it otherwise and wish it had worked! Lot of good features! Is great the company is 'thinking out of the box' with new designs.",6
20,880,1448900615,Either the design is not good for my large nose or the design is poor. This is the noisiest head gear I have ever worn. The air makes a roar as it passes through the head gear to the nose so much it keeps me awake. I will stick with my present nasal pillow system.,4
20,881,1448642576,"This is the third mask of three I've tried so far, as a new CPAP user.  This is my favorite of the three, over the Pico and Nano masks I tried first.  I switch between back and side sleeping, and the Pico leaked like crazy when I went on my side, while the Nano was much better.  But this one is the best - with the hose on top of your head the mask itself stays on way better when you shift around during sleep.  I have a medium density mustache, too, and I've had zero problems with leaking out the bottom where the mask goes on the mustache.  And the air flow to the mask when I'm on my side is just fine - no issues with reduced airflow from pinching of the one side - the other side handles it just fine.",3
20,882,1448636409,"The medium Dream Wear was too big had a lot of ""air noise""; however the small Dream Wear is comfortable and works well.  I love the design, that a hose is not in front of me or my face.  The nose cushion is much more comfortable, as nothing is in the nostrils.  The soft air channels are also comfortable on my head, though the air passage is more pronounced. I've noticed less marks on my face in the morning, too.",5
20,883,1448376262,"I wore a standard cpap mask for years and it worked pretty well, but this new DreamWare mask is great.\\r\\nI like the fact that it is open in the front, fits great and is much quieter.\\r\\nI would recommend this over any other mask",5

20,886,1448203963,"I wanted to love to love this mask, but it didn't happen. The strap that goes behind the head would not stay in place no matter how much I tightened it. It would slip up every time I turned my head causing the mask to leak. I loved the design of the mask itself and if they redesign the back strap, I would try it again.",12
20,887,1447941445,"I love the feel and comfort  of wearing this  nasal mask versus my usual  pillow mask.  I  have only tried this mask for 3 nights; I am in the process of trying the different sizes as my partner said he could hear me lightly snoring; I was aware  of it too and I was letting out some air through my mouth.  I  had to adjust the mask several times during the night.    I will keep experimenting with  the different sizes as I so want this mask to work especially because of the comfort.     I have not found a mask yet that I have a full nights sleep; I use an Apap machine  so  when the air pressure goes up, it tends to wake me up as the nasal pillows must get moved out of place.

20,891,1447859271,I have gone 3 years and at least 15 different masks. All the full face masks hurt the bridge of my nose and a lot of the others leaked or didn't stay stable at night and would leak around the nasal pillows. This is the best ever mask for comfort and effectiveness in use. I am impressed and I hope they never stop making this one. This is the best of the best!,9
20,892,1447850479,ingenious yet simple design.  nasal piece does not leak.  VERY comfortable.  Inlet connector on top of head so if the hose connects from above you do no wrestle with a snake around your neck all night.  I hope they NEVER stop making this mask,7

They are both lightweight, fit well, unobtrusive, and allow for lots of sleeping positions and turning over at night.  You cannot go wrong with either of these masks.  However, there are differences that may make a difference to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeight:  The Airfit is lighter and lower profile on your face\\r\\nMovement:  The Dreamwear moves less on your face as you toss and turn\\r\\nHose:  The Dreamwear's top of head hose attachment is preferable to the Airfit\\r\\nNoise:  The Airfit is quieter on exhalation\\r\\nWind on Partner:  The Airfit does not blow on my wife where the Dreamwear does\\r\\nFacial Marks:  The Airfit left no facial marks in the morning.  The Dreamwear left some and they were fairly wide\\r\\nComfort:  The Dreamwear was a little more comfortable on my nose but that much better than the Airfit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, I kept my Airfit and sent back the Dreamwear.  For me it came down to noise and wind on my wife (if momma ain't happy.....).  I also preferred the lower profile and lighter weight of the Airfit.  A mask that combined the best aspects of both would be a game changer.",10

20,898,1447433890,"I am halfway through my trial month of this nasal mask.  I like its low profile, the top-mounted hose connection and the way my nose fits into the nosepiece with hardly a leak.  What I don't like is the big rush of air through the ""whisper valve"" (could they not have put a diffuser in?) and the way the headgear rides up in back (I am an active sleeper).  To be honest, the latter problem is one I have with any nasal mask or pillow construct, so it is not really a criticism of this mask.  Overall, I do like it better than the Airfit P10 which I had been using prior to purchase, because my nose feels a lot better in the morning.  I will have more to say in a few weeks.",3
20,899,1447355618,"I needed to replace my current nasal pillow mask when I saw this DreamWear mask was now available, and jumped to order it immediately.  I was enlisted by Phillips Respronics to particpate in the company's trials of this mask over a year ago.  I wore and used this design for three months and hated to return the product once the trial ended because I loved it so much.  I have only had my new mask purchased through CPAP.com for two nights, but it is everything I remebered and could want.  This is by far the most comfortable mask I have ever used.  It is the least intrusive and it provides excellent air.  Unlike masks with nose pillows in the nostrals, the breathing piece rests comfortably beneath your nose and has a slit that allows the air to flow into your nose, yet you don't need a chamber sticking out from your face surrounding your entire nose.  It  is a great blend between a traditional nasal mask and the nasal pillow design.  Additionally, the mask has a quick release attachment to the hose from the CPAP machine which allows the user to detach easily without removing the mask for those middle of the night rest room trips - very easy to reattach and quickly fall back to sleep.  For the first time user, there may be a night or two period of adjustment to the new design, but you will love it.  Also the mask comes with every size nasal cushion necessary for the perfect fit - no more ordering the wrong size by mistake.  I highly recommend this design.  Just be willing to wear it nightly and in less than a week you will find it to be the best possible device for CPAP therapy you could imagine.",5
20,900,1447335408,"I have used the dreamwear mask for 4 nights now. I cant say enough good about it.  My leak numbers on the old mask were in the high 40's, with this mask they have been under 8.  My AHI has been averaging 1.4!!  Its very light weight and comfortable. Takes a little getting use to how it fits and how to wear it but once I did I love it!!  I haven't figured out yet to lie on my side without it leaking but I'm working on that.  I used the same mask for several years but recently lost a lot of weight and now it simply will not fit so when I saw my sleep doctor last week he highly recommended this. I ordered it the same day and this is my new mask for the long haul!!",2

20,905,1447096046,"I appreciated the opportunity to try a nasal-bud type cpap mask again like the Respironics DreamWear. I was so hoping that I would be able to use it since it works with less stuff on your face. However, I needed to return it for these reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. The air pressure directly applied to my nasal-sinus area by this mask is still too uncomfortable for me. I currently use the Resmed Mirage FX, which applies the pressure more indirectly and I find it more acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\n  2. The DreamWear produces more noise around my head, which I find annoying. It's not loud enough to wake my spouse, but it does make it hard for me to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. The DreamWear does not have any detachable hose coupling. If you have to get up in the middle of the night, you have to take off the entire mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy current mask (Resmed Mirage FX) is very quiet, has the detachable hose feature and is tolerated very well, except for the extra hardware on my face. The DreamWear did not do enough to help me. Of the nasal-bud type cpap masks, the DreamWear was somewhat easier to get used to. I was able to sleep some, but not very well.  Hope this helps someone.",12

I'm a side sleeper, and all the others I tried tugged on my ears, blew air in my eyes constantly, made huge creases in my face, and every time I turned over, I woke up enough to adjust the hose for comfort.  This one allows me to sleep comfortably on my side ALL night without air in my eyes or waking up to adjust the hose.  And, it takes only seconds to put on instead of 30 minutes of adjustment to get it comfortable.  THIS IS AWESOME and a major step forward in comfort!",12

At a pressure setting of 13, I struggled to get adequate air and maintain an airtight seal.  Also, the mask vents straight out from the front of the mask which is annoying to my bride.  She doesn't care for the ""gale force wind"" blowing directly on her.  I ended up returning to my old mask.",9

I am still trying to get used to using the CPAP, but this mask definitely makes it easier.  The hose is out of the way and there is no problem with it disconnecting or being in my way while sleeping.  The headgear is very comfortable on my head and face (no need for pads provided, at least for me); headgear stays in place very well.  Seal is excellent; no issues yet at all.

(The ""pillow"" sizes are XS and S, depending on the mask.) Lately my nostrils have been exceptionally sore and nothing I tried provided comfort.  I decided to try the DreamWear Nasal mask.  Oh my!!!  I have been using it for about a week. The hose is connected at the top.  The air goes through the mask on both sides (right near your ears) so you can hear the air. I thought that would be a problem.  It isn't for me.  Once adjusted, I have had no air leaks, found it quite comfortable and have gotten the best sleep I have had in years!",2

The nasal cushion is a brilliant design, and it seals extremely well as long as you use the right size. I use a small and have had excellent overnight AHI results with no large leaks at all. The head gear is comfortable, stays in place, and the tubing leaves NO MARKS on my face---a winner for sure!",2

I have gone back and forth a few times and settled on the Med. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in a long time I am making all the way through the night without removing my mask.

20,927,1446573187,"I have been using a CPAP machine now for under a year and it has been tough getting use too.  I purchased the ResMed AirSense 10 as my machine and a regular Phillips respironics nasal mask as my first mask. I really only got that one because it came with the Test machine from Kaiser.  Anyway, first thing that happened was ir scared my kids from coming in to my bed in the morning to snuggle and caused a lot of questions. (8,7,5 year olds)  I was a bit bummed about scaring them, but what else can i do.  It seems i had to crank that thing down so tight to my face to keep it from leaking that it was annoying, painful, and basically just sucked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to try a Pillow mask so i purchased one from CPAP.com, i don't want to give the brand and model I purchased since it probably isn't fair to complain when some people do like it.  It just didn't work for me.  It felt like i had to cram that think up my nose so tight that I would imagine its like someone picking you up off the ground by cramming two fingers up your nose.   Really wasnt any fun at all haha... i tried it for nearly a month and really had no choice since the nasal mask I had before decided to break on me when i was swapping back and fourth a few nights.   My nose would get really sore like it was bruised and would never have time to heal.   The only good point was the kids started coming back in in the morning, but would now be on the other side of the bed haha.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, i saw this DreamWear Nasal mask listed but didn't have any reviews so i waited to see when the first reviews came in but i just couldn't take the other mask anymore and the time was running out to return it.  it was between this DreamWear and the other top rated Nasal mask right now that seemed over the top with straps and a big contraption on face.  Tough call for me cause i want to sleep better but I also don't want to scare the crap out of my little kids and the other nasal mask looks scary.  I'm pretty sure my wife wont sleep near me with that one so..... I ordered the dreamwear mask and received it...\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I didn't think it was going to stay on through the night, it doesn't feel as tight on your face as either of the other two masks i have used.  But it did, stayed right in place. (unlike the pillow where i have waken up and found it on the floor ten feet away... once time stuck to my forehead) I played with the adjustments a bit, after i put it on i kind of push up on the bottom to place it as high as i can above the stash area (i have no stash, cant grow one... whole other story for another time).  I love the connection on the top of the head, it keeps the tube from laying on my chest at night which is not only annoying but reminds me that i have to wear this stupid thing in the first place.  At first i kept trying to push it toward the back of my head, but it really sits right on the top.  The whole mask fits correctly in a specific area, if you don't try to force this thing into the wrong position (which for some reason at first, didn't feel like the right position) and just learn the correct spot, it is it very comfortable and just works very nicely. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will say that it is a bit more noisy then the other masks i have used, the breathing noise can be heard and the noise increases a bit when you lay on your side.  I think it closes off one of the side tubes so that more air flows through the other and increases the noise.  It doesn't really bother me much most of the time but if it does for some reason, i just re-adjust my position.  After a week or so, i don't really notice and if i do change position it must be just automatic at this point.  One thing i might do is get some sort of cloth to wrap or put the tube through that goes to the machine.  Since it comes out of the top of my head, it does does rub against the wood on my bed and makes a noise.  This isn't a big deal, but if they sell the cloth from CPAP (which i think they do) you might want to order it at the same time to save on shipping.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCleaning is easy and so far this is the best i have had.   As far as a rating,  we all know that wearing this stuff sucks but i got to say that i cant see any mask working better or feeling more comfortable than this one.  I'm pretty sure that i am not ordering any other masks ever!  I will just reorder the parts for this when they get worn out and continue with it.  I'm glad i found a mask that keeps me from having to think about which mask i am going to try next.  in my experience with this, I am  telling you that you should just order this is the one to try.  OH! i did notice that when i used the pillow mask, my stats on my machine got worse and worse...  with the dreamwear mask, everything seems to be coming right back to normal and I am sleeping better.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy final note, the kids venture back in and haven't freaked on on this mask so far.. haha... good luck!!  \\r\\n\\r\\nI give it 5 stars!  Best so far and they deserve it for designing a new mask that really focuses on trying to be comfortable.",2
20,928,1446568207,"I found that the mask was too noisy for me to get to sleep with. While I'm a light sleeper, I did do side-by-side comparisons of the noise from the Swift FX and this mask and was amazed by how much louder this mask is.

In addition, the air coming down the soft tubes beside the head makes a constant noise which gets worse when you turn on your side and partially compress one of the tubes.  You also need to have nasal openings that exactly fit one of the nose pillows to get a seal.  Unfortunately my nose did not fit any of the nose pillows.  I also purchased the large frame which helped a little, however the mask was still made too much noise.",7

Whoever coined the term pillow for those nostril torture devices had a good sense of humor :-)\\r\\n\\r\\nI've tried 3 different pillow products previously  from 3 different mfrs. and although they were SO much better from a sleeping, rolling around standpoint, they would eventually make my nose so raw I could not use them. Since then I went to the Wisp and it has been my go-to for the last 3 months. It wakes me up as I roll around and leaks a lot, but my nostrils are not a mess.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm now in week two with this new DreamWear and I think it is my new fav. When you see the single oval opening in the nose piece you can't imagine how it will not leak like crazy. But, the softness and flexibility of the material right there actually kind of ""inflates"" around your nostrils and it works... It requires the least amount of pressure of anything I have tried to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also is BY FAR the least intrusive I've used as far as allowing comfortable side sleeping, and not being clumsy when rolling from one side to the other.

If you stayed in the same position it would be OK, or probably for a back sleeper.\\r\\n- The mask is much noisier AFAIAC than the P10. The sound of your inhale and exhale are amplified by the side tubes and bone conductivity to be quite loud.\\r\\n- Also noisy is the vent at the top elbow, quite bothersome to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll-in-all I was disappointed that the mask was not my ""dreamwear"" and I will be returning it. It is a great concept, and might be good for back sleepers who don't mind the noise.",8
20,949,1445955889,"I have used the Direct Seal Comfort Lite 2 for several years, since I started using CPAP. Unfortunately, it is no longer available and my supplies are starting to run low. I have tried several nasal pillow style masks and have not been impressed. None have worked for me well enough to use a second night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tried the DreamWear Mask for several nights, a new record for new tries. It has several advantages for me. The hose attaches at the top of the head, like the Comfort Lite, so that the hose does not get tangled in covers and hands during the night. It has a new, to me at least, sealing system. Instead of a nasal opening direct seal or an intrusive nasal ""pillow"", there is an oval opening that extends across both nostrils. The seal sits on the edge of the end of the nose and works surprisingly well. The small air tickle on the area between the nostrils has required some getting used to but does not keep me awake. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only significant difficulty comes with side sleeping. It is possible to maintain the seal by placing the head on the pillow just so, but any movement against the pillow is likely to break the seal and wake me up. One of the huge advantages of the old ComfortLite 2 was its rigid forehead foundation that allowed side sleeping without jarring the mask at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is clearly the best of the new masks so far. I will use it several more days at least (a record) to determine if I can get used to it to use it regularly. Last night I slept almost as well as I usually do with my obsolete but preferred mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne note on size. The size selector that comes with the kit suggested one size for me to us. I did use that size for one night with extreme difficulty with side sleeping. I then tried the next larger size and got much better but still not great results. You will probably need to experiment as well. I appreciate the starter kit that comes with all size pillows for just such experimentation.",2

After over fifteen years of using a cpap unit, I can finally sleep without having to constantly adjust my mask during the night.  This mask has a new nose piece that fits comfortably, doesn't need much adjusting during the night and functions perfectly.  The mask and hose follow me as I turn side to side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is nice to see a company breaking away from the normal nose piece design, with the angled nosiy pieces, which never fit my nose, as my nostrils are straight not angled!  Too bad more manufacturers don't step out of the norm and create better equipment.  I'd like to see the nose pieces be adjustable so they might fit everyone better.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't like the headgear.

The medium frame is actually a little too big for my head so I am thinking females might be better served by ordering the small. I am able to deal with the bigger frame by wearing my hair in a ponytail that is between the top hose and the back headgear straps. That seems to keep anything from slipping.

20,1000,1445285065,"I use a Swift Fx and my major complaint is leaking air from the headgear pulling on the nasal pillow and breaking contact with my nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following feedback is based on 5 continuous nights use.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary:\\r\\nI was hoping the DreamWear would address the leaking problems, but, alas, it does not.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros:\\r\\nThe DreamWear is comfortable once you get used to the feel on your skin and different pressure points on your cheeks.  It definitely provides a better seal if you sleep on your back than the Swift Fx.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hose placement is non-obtrusive and does not interfere with sleeping nor did it get tangled or place any pressure on your head.  Note: I sleep with the hose suspended from my headboard.  I give the hose design a big thumbs up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nasal pillow is comfortable and I like that it does not protrude into your nose where it can sometimes rub.  In some ways I would liken the design to the DreamWeaver Elan without the fabric bulk when inflated.  Washing this pillow is a breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the cheek straps to deliver the air is an inspired design and it works well.  I noticed no difference in pressure when sleeping on my side or back.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhaled air is redirected in two locations.  At the elbow swivel connector on top of the head and a smaller vent in the nasal pillow.  Neither location created any discomfort from air blowing on you and I think the nasal vent will be weak enough not to disturb your partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\nI still have issue with the mask leaking when I turn onto my side or if I shift my head too much when resting on my back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem stems from the neoprene head gear catching on the pillow and dragging instead of sliding. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the root cause of all of my problems with different brands of cpap masks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have long straight hair.  This creates another problem for me and that is the head gear riding up and causes the mask to get out of position multiple times during the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn issue with sleeping on my side is the mask deforms and breaks the seal with my nose.  I end up sleeping with my hand gently pressing on the center of the mask to keep the seal intact. If an XS size is ever produced, I would definitely consider trying it to see if it will resolve the gap created when I shift positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last concern I have is the durability of the nasal pillow.  To form the seal to your nose, the silicone is quite thin around the opening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead band could use more adjustment points.  To keep it simple, there is one tab on each side to tighten or loosen.  For a toss and turn sleeper, this is not enough.  perhaps a design the cradles around the exterior of the head will create less drag on the headgear?\\r\\n\\r\\nOther observations:  The air pressure felt \\u201clow\\u201d since it was not directly forced into each nares.  By the second night it was feeling more \\u201cnormal\\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion:  I will continue to wear this mask for another week and try different adjustments.   I think I will end up using this as a backup mask in the event I have a nasal irritation that requires a day or two to heal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy search for a mask that will allow me to sleep through the night continues.\\r\\n",8

20,1002,1445267060,I have never had a more comfortable mask.  I can't even tell I am wearing a mask. It does not leak! I never have to adjust it during the night. I like the air supply over my head instead of at my chin!  GREAT MASK!,1
20,1003,1445266946,"This mask is a replacement to a nasal pillow mask that I have had for some time. So far I like it. My old mask had a tendency to leak if it was moved in the middle of the night. The mask has an opening that spans across both nostrils. The seal is great. I wake up less as a result. A leaky mask causes pressure to increase on my CPAP. As a result, when the leak is resealed from movement, I am suddenly dealing with a higher pressure. This results in air going to my stomach. This version of the mask is much less prone to this issue. The chances of a leak are much lower for this mask. The level of comfort is higher as well. There are no pillows that protrude into your nostrils. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe air enters at a port at the top of your head. The air travels down the tube\\/straps to the nasal mask. The air supply feeds are touching your head and face, they remain warmer as they supply air to the mask. This results in less condensation. Condensation (if any) tends to collect higher up in the air supply leads.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondensation Notes: I woke up after leaving my window open to the cold one night. The next morning, I rolled over from my left side to my right side. The condensation travelled back towards the port at the top of my head. As I rolled onto my other side, the condensation exited my mask at the front vent rather into my nose. I remember seeing this and I was surprised that I did not get a nose full of water. Excellent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe port at the top of the head is nice. I find that I am reaching towards my mask to adjust a hose that is no longer there. This is nice. Occasionally, my hose at the top of my head needs some type of adjustment due to the 90 degree angle.\\r\\n",2

If there is a sweet spot for the DreamWear mask I have yet to find it and may be returning it.,2
20,1006,1445184588,I have been using Resmed's Swift FX Bella for several years and been satisfied. This DreamWear Nasal mask has met and exceeded my expectations! It is SO comfortable and I love having the air port at the top of my head where turning and moving doesn't disturb the seating of the mask. Highly recommend it!,0
20,1007,1445129901,"This is so comfortable; the closest thing to not wearing a mask at all. The frame is soft and squishy, so it's not very noticeable no matter what position you sleep in. I love the clear field of vision, if I need to put my glasses on, or even watch TV with it on. And the red marks I've had on the bridge of my nose for the past couple of years, from previous masks, are finally almost gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside is that the mask is pretty noisy, I guess because of the air blowing through the frame. It sometimes makes it hard to get to sleep, although it doesn't normally wake me up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've only had this for a few nights, but am quite happy with it so far, despite the noise.",3
20,1008,1445117165,The best mask I have tried.  My husband said he turned the light on to see why there was no noise coming from my C-Pap Mask. He said it was the quietest mask I have worn. I love my Swift Fix but this mask is even more comfortable.  I have been a C-Pap user for over 10 years and this mask is the best so far.,0
20,1009,1445115614,Could not wear this mask..it leaked and was really loud,3
20,1010,1445113935,I have had this mask for two days and I am already sleeping better than I ever did with my previous favorite mask.  I highly recommend this mask.  I feel like I almost don't have a mask on at all.  It is a wonderful feeling after six years of CPAP treatment,0
20,1011,1445112118,I have tried a number of masks. This new one is the most comfortable one so far. Highly recommended.,0
20,1012,1445110838,Love the fit and no more dealing with the hose at my neck. I had to turn down the humidity because water was collecting.,1
20,1013,1445110309,"Although this mask is very comfortable and I love the swivel elbow hose connection, it is very noisy.  It fits easily and well, no leaks, but the air flow noise, even during ramp up, is unacceptably high.",7
20,1014,1445106993,I have been using this headset for 1 week so far I like it.\\r\\nVery light and stays on better that I was exspecting,0
20,1015,1445102718,"This is a nice idea, and its nice the fit kit provides 4 sizes, but all sizes leak in real use. Theres just not a good seal. Had to return. Also tried 2 other recent releases. The Best from my perspective is the Airfit P10.",1
20,1016,1445101881,"I have been a user of CPAP, and now APAP, mask and machines for over ten years now.  I have tried all of the full face masks available, and new ones as they become available.  None have worked for me.  I have always gone back to my old standby, the  ResMed Swift FX Nasal Pillow Mask.  I recently ordered the DreamWear Nasal Mask, and it really works for me.  Very comfortable, very light, and I hardly know its on.  Looks like my new go to standby will be the DreamWear Nasal Mask!",0
20,1017,1445099965,"I've been entirely satisfied with the original Comfort Gel mask over the nose and was reluctant to change. However, I've used the new DreamWear mask 4 nights and I'm delighted with the comfortable fit. No leaks, works perfectly from the first night. I'm glad I made the change. Only negative comment is that I do hear my breathing through the nose fitting, but it doesn't bother me.",0
20,1018,1445097615,"By far the most comfortable mask I have used and I've tried 7 different ones, do yourself a favor and get one!",0
20,1019,1445096980,"After struggling with nasal gel pillows for over a year and never having a good nights sleep, I decided to try the DreamWear Nasal Mask.  I actually slept through the night the first time I used it.  No waking multiple times at night to readjust it as I had done with the nasal pillows.   The fit is very comfortable including the tubing that attaches at the top of the mask.  No more getting tangled up in the hose.   I highly recommend that you try this mask.",0
20,1020,1445090655,"The product works as advertised. Had a hard time choosing which of the four nasal pillow sizes to use, despite sizing my nose using the nose-size gauge that comes with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy main complaints are threefold:\\r\\nFelt like I was not able to breath as well, compared to my traditional face mask. (Admittedly, I've not used a nasal pillow before, so perhaps I'm just not used to the feel of it.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEach breath is quite noisey, as the air rushes by my ears as it transits the side passages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I sleep on my side (which is most of the time), the side tube between head and pillow tends to get restricted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the above notwithstanding, I've decided to keep this rather unique mask to see if I can get used to it. Neat concept! But I'll only give it a grade of B.",3
20,1021,1445089747,I have had the new headset for two nights and so far it works well with one exception.  When I sleep on my side the nasal flow gets pushed out of place and is loud.  I will try some of the different attachments and tighten the headset to see if that fixes the issue.  More to come -,2
20,1022,1445089170,"I love, love my Dreamwear. I have had 4 different styles of masks, searching for a comfortable fit and less bundlesum.\\r\\nThis is so perfect, light weight and stays in place, but most of all so comfortable!!!",0
20,1023,1445087970,first mask that did not leave irritation and my face and works,1
25,1,15-Apr-17,"The soft edge on my old one was blowing up and covering my nostrils, and it leaked air his was noisy and also irritated my eyes. This took care of all those problems. I like it ND I am sleeping much better now. Shipping was fast. Definitely A good decision.",9
25,2,10-Jul-18,"I have mixed feelings about this mask. If pressed, I would rate it as my top mask and am continuing to use it. Having used another version of this type of over-the nose gasket type mask and several pillow cushion varieties, I find the gasket style less prone to irritate or awaken me in some way during the night, and this one, for me, was the better of the two. The other version of this type did not provide adequate sealing beyond the first week of usage, perhaps because I have a face shape that does not fit the parameters of their contour - I don't know. I needed to constantly use an eye mask to keep air from blowing up into my eyes. This one does, but that cure comes with its own problem: it rubs the bridge of my nose to irritation (red mark, even red bump as if the beginning of a blister were forming). Fortunately, the red mark goes away during the day and is hidden while present under the cross bar connecting the two lenses of my glasses. So - while this mask is not perfect, its plusses definitely outweigh its minuses and I will continue using it until I find a better product",0
25,3,30-May-18,"Being new to the CPAP community, we didn't know that different Respro masks are NOT interchangeable. MAYBE state that tubing with elbow and swivel are needed. Thanks.",4
25,4,5-Aug-18,I read everything on this product before i bought it. The title of the product has been updated now. Everything I read made me feel like this was an actual mask. It's only pillow replacements for the actual mask.,3
25,5,3-Mar-17,"This Wisp Nasal CPAP mask is such a huge improvement from the nasal pillows. It gently fits perfectly, no leaks.",6
23,1,21-Oct-19,"Poorly designed, does not seal properly, clips come undone very easily, Velcro straps not secure. Returned to previous mask supplied with machine. This was a waste of money for ma and not cheap!",1
23,2,26-Jan-20,"I originally started CPAP with a ResMed Airfit F20. It was horrible, I ended up with a massive blister which took ages to heal before being given this mask by my sleep clinic. Wow, it was amazing from day one but I did change from a medium mask to a small as there was leaking from the sides of my nose as the mask began to stretch. The only difference between the small mask and the medium is the cut out for the area the nose covers, every other part of the mask has the same dimensions. My advice is that if you are just over the small sizing go with the small and not the medium. I have successfully been using this mask now with my ResMed Airsense 10 with heated tube without any issues for nearly 2 years. I have never used any cushions or gauze between my mask and my face and I have never experienced any discomfort or skin sores unlike with previous masks. If it hadn’t been for this mask I very much doubt I could have continued with CPAP therapy as the other masks were just too uncomfortable. In fact I can’t get to sleep without the mask on. I can not fault this mask at all, thank you Philips for a design that allows you to read with your glasses on and be able to watch television whilst drifting off into a comfortable slumber. 10/10 for me!",5
